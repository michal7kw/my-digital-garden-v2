# Alpha-GPC

## Overview

Alpha-GPC (L-Alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine) is the most bioavailable choline supplement, providing 40% choline by weight. It efficiently crosses the blood-brain barrier and is used clinically in Europe for cognitive disorders.

**Evidence Level: 4/5** - Strong clinical evidence; pharmaceutical use in Europe.

## Mechanism of Action

### Cholinergic Support
```
Alpha-GPC
    ↓ (absorbed intact or hydrolyzed)
Choline + Glycerophosphate
    ↓
Choline → Acetylcholine (ACh)
       → Phosphatidylcholine (PC)
```

### Growth Hormone Effects
- Activates cholinergic neurons in hypothalamus
- Stimulates GHRH release
- 600mg pre-exercise increased GH 44-fold (vs placebo)

## Comparison with Citicoline

| Aspect | Alpha-GPC | Citicoline |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Choline content | 40% | 18% |
| Additional compounds | Glycerophosphate | Cytidine (→ uridine) |
| GH effects | Stronger | Minimal |
| Membrane support | Via PC | Stronger |
| Cost | Higher | Moderate |

## Clinical Evidence

| Application | Dose | Finding |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Cognitive decline | 1200mg/day | Improved cognitive scores |
| Athletic performance | 600mg | Increased power output, GH |
| Stroke recovery | 1000mg/day | Enhanced recovery |
| Healthy adults | 400mg | Improved memory |
