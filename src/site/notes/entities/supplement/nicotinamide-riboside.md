# Nicotinamide Riboside

## Overview

Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) is a form of vitamin B3 that serves as a direct precursor to NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). It was identified as an NAD+ precursor in 2004 and has since become one of the most studied longevity supplements.

NR has several advantages over other NAD+ precursors:
- **No flushing** (unlike niacin)
- **Efficient pathway** (via NRK enzymes)
- **Bypasses NAMPT** (age-related decline in NAMPT doesn't limit NR)
- **Well-studied** (multiple human clinical trials)

## NAD+ Biosynthesis Pathways

### NR → NAD+ (Salvage via NRK)
1. **NRK1/NRK2**: NR + ATP → NMN + ADP
2. **NMNAT1-3**: NMN + ATP → NAD+ + PPi

### Comparison with Other Precursors
| Precursor | Pathway | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **NR** | NRK → NMN → NAD+ | Efficient, no flush |
| **NMN** | NMNAT → NAD+ | Direct, but larger molecule |
| **Nicotinamide** | NAMPT → NMN → NAD+ | Rate-limited by NAMPT |
| **Niacin** | Preiss-Handler | Causes flushing |
| **Tryptophan** | De novo synthesis | Very inefficient |

## Effects on NAD+ Metabolism

### NAD+ Elevation
- Human studies show 40-90% increase in blood NAD+
- Dose-dependent response (100-1000 mg)
- Effects seen within 1-2 weeks

### Downstream Effects
- **SIRT1 activation**: Metabolic regulation, longevity
- **SIRT3 activation**: Mitochondrial function
- **PARP support**: DNA repair
- **CD38**: Still consumes NAD+ (potential limitation)

## Clinical Evidence

### Human Trials

**Martens et al., 2018** (Nature Communications)
- 24 adults, 500 mg NR × 6 weeks
- Reduced blood pressure
- Reduced arterial stiffness
- Well tolerated

**Dollerup et al., 2018** (American Journal of Clinical Nutrition)
- 40 obese men, 1000 mg NR × 12 weeks
- Increased NAD+ metabolome
- No effect on insulin sensitivity
- Safe and well tolerated

**Elhassan et al., 2019** (Cell Reports)
- 12 adults, 1000 mg NR × 3 weeks
- Increased NAD+ in muscle
- Altered mitochondrial bioenergetics
- Gene expression changes

### Key Findings
- Consistent NAD+ elevation across trials
- Cardiovascular benefits in some studies
- Muscle/mitochondrial effects observed
- Generally safe with mild side effects

## Mechanism Connections

### Sirtuin Activation
- NAD+ is required substrate for sirtuins
- SIRT1: Nuclear metabolism, longevity
- SIRT3: Mitochondrial metabolism
- Links energy status to gene regulation

### Mitochondrial Biogenesis
- Via SIRT1 → PGC-1α pathway
- NR increases mitochondrial function markers
- Supports oxidative metabolism

### DNA Repair
- NAD+ supports PARP enzyme function
- Critical for genome maintenance
- May contribute to longevity effects

## Comparison: NR vs NMN

| Factor | NR | NMN |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Molecular weight | 255 Da | 334 Da |
| Transport | Enters cells directly | May require conversion |
| Price | Generally lower | Generally higher |
| Human trials | More published | Fewer (but increasing) |
| NAD+ elevation | Confirmed | Confirmed |
| Bioavailability | Well characterized | Still being studied |

## Supplement Quality

### ChromaDex Niagen
- Most studied form
- Licensed to multiple brands
- Analytical certificates available

### Quality Considerations
- Purity testing important
- NR can degrade to nicotinamide
- Look for third-party testing
