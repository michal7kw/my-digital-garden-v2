# Hippocampus

## Overview (Consumer-Friendly)

The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped structure deep in your brain that acts as your memory center. Think of it as your brain's "save button" - it helps you form new memories and recall past experiences. It's also crucial for finding your way around and learning new skills.

### Key Functions
- Creating new memories from experiences
- Remembering facts and events (like where you parked your car)
- Navigating spaces and finding your way
- Learning new information and skills
- Emotional memory formation

### Lifestyle Tips for Hippocampal Health
- **Exercise regularly** - Aerobic exercise promotes new neuron growth in the hippocampus
- **Get quality sleep** - Memory consolidation happens during sleep
- **Learn new things** - Challenge your brain with novel experiences
- **Manage stress** - Chronic stress can shrink the hippocampus
- **Stay socially active** - Social engagement supports brain health

## Clinical Information (Medical Professional)

### Neuroanatomy
The hippocampus is a paired structure located in the medial temporal lobe, consisting of the cornu ammonis (CA) fields CA1-CA4, dentate gyrus, and subiculum. It receives major inputs from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant pathway and projects to various cortical and subcortical regions via the fornix.

### Cytoarchitecture
- **CA1**: Large pyramidal neurons, vulnerable to ischemia (Sommer's sector)
- **CA2**: Resistant to excitotoxicity, important for social memory
- **CA3**: Dense recurrent collaterals, pattern completion
- **CA4**: Part of dentate gyrus, neurogenesis zone
- **Dentate Gyrus**: Granule cells, one of few sites of adult neurogenesis

### Common Pathologies
- **Alzheimer's Disease**: Early and severe atrophy, neurofibrillary tangles
- **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy**: Hippocampal sclerosis, mesial temporal sclerosis
- **Depression**: Reduced volume, impaired neurogenesis
- **PTSD**: Structural and functional abnormalities
- **Hypoxic-ischemic injury**: CA1 particularly vulnerable

### Clinical Assessment
- **Structural MRI**: Volumetric analysis, asymmetry assessment
- **Functional MRI**: Activation during memory encoding/retrieval
- **Neuropsychological Testing**: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Logical Memory
- **PET Imaging**: Glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), amyloid imaging
- **Diffusion Tensor Imaging**: White matter tract integrity

### Differential Diagnosis
- Memory impairment: Alzheimer's vs. vascular dementia vs. depression vs. normal aging
- Seizures: Temporal lobe epilepsy vs. frontal lobe epilepsy vs. psychogenic non-epileptic seizures

- **ARC**: Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein - synaptic plasticity
