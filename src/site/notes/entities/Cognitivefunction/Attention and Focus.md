# Attention and Focus

## Overview (Consumer-Friendly)

Attention and focus are your brain's abilities to selectively concentrate on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Unlike a simple spotlight, attention is a complex cognitive system with multiple components working together to help you navigate the constant stream of information bombarding your senses. Your attention system involves a network of brain regions including the prefrontal cortex (executive control), parietal cortex (spatial attention), and the locus coeruleus (alertness and vigilance).

### Types of Attention

**1. Sustained Attention (Vigilance):**
- Maintaining focus on a task over time
- Norepinephrine from locus coeruleus critical for alertness
- Example: Watching for a specific car while driving for hours
- Declines with fatigue, sleep deprivation

**2. Selective Attention (Focus):**
- Concentrating on one thing while ignoring distractions
- Prefrontal cortex inhibits irrelevant information
- Example: Reading a book in a noisy coffee shop
- Impaired in ADHD, anxiety

**3. Divided Attention (Multitasking):**
- Attending to multiple tasks simultaneously
- Actually rapid task-switching (true parallel processing is limited)
- Prefrontal cortex coordination required
- Example: Talking on phone while cooking
- Performance degrades compared to single-tasking

**4. Executive Attention (Cognitive Control):**
- Directing attention based on goals, suppressing automatic responses
- Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex
- Example: Ignoring your phone to finish a work deadline
- Develops slowly through childhood, declines in aging

**5. Orienting Attention (Spatial Attention):**
- Shifting attention to new stimuli in the environment
- Parietal cortex, superior colliculus
- Example: Noticing a sudden movement in your peripheral vision
- Preserved in ADHD, impaired after parietal damage

### Lifestyle Tips for Optimal Attention

- **Adequate sleep**: Sleep deprivation severely impairs attention (24hr awake = 0.1% BAC cognitive impairment)
- **Regular breaks**: Sustained attention declines after 20-30 minutes (Pomodoro technique)
- **Minimize multitasking**: Task-switching reduces efficiency by 40%, increases errors
- **Aerobic exercise**: Increases norepinephrine, dopamine, BDNF (enhances attention)
- **Mindfulness meditation**: Strengthens sustained and selective attention networks
- **Limit distractions**: Turn off notifications, create focused work environment
- **Strategic caffeine use**: Improves alertness, sustained attention (100-200mg optimal)
- **Adequate hydration**: Even mild dehydration (2%) impairs attention

## Clinical Information (Medical Professional)

### Neuroanatomy of Attention Networks

**Posner and Petersen Model:** Three attention networks

**1. Alerting Network:**
- **Locus Coeruleus → Widespread NE Projections**
  - Maintains arousal, vigilance, readiness to respond
  - Norepinephrine (NE) modulates signal-to-noise ratio in cortex
  - Tonic LC firing: Sustained alertness
  - Phasic LC firing: Orienting to salient stimuli
- **Thalamus**: Regulates cortical arousal
- **Right Frontal and Parietal Cortex**: Sustains alertness over time
- **Impairment**: Sleep deprivation, sedatives, brain injury

**2. Orienting Network:**
- **Parietal Cortex**:
  - Posterior parietal cortex: Spatial attention, attentional shifts
  - Intraparietal sulcus: Disengaging and shifting attention
  - Lesions: Hemispatial neglect (ignores contralateral space)
- **Superior Colliculus**: Rapid eye movements to salient stimuli
- **Pulvinar (Thalamus)**: Filters sensory information, enhances attended stimuli
- **Frontal Eye Fields**: Voluntary eye movements, spatial attention
- **Acetylcholine**: Basal forebrain → Parietal cortex (enhances sensory processing)

**3. Executive Control Network:**
- **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC)**:
  - Top-down attentional control
  - Maintains task-relevant information, suppresses distractors
  - Working memory, goal maintenance
- **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**:
  - Conflict monitoring, error detection
  - Signals when attentional control is needed
  - Allocates executive resources
- **Inferior Frontal Cortex**: Response inhibition (stop signals)
- **Dopamine**: Critical for executive attention, working memory
- **Norepinephrine**: Modulates PFC function (α2A receptors)

### Neurotransmitter Systems

**Norepinephrine (NE):**
- **Locus Coeruleus → Widespread Cortical Projections**
- **Critical for arousal, alertness, sustained attention**
- **α2A receptors** in PFC: Enhance signal-to-noise, improve focus (guanfacine for ADHD)
- **α1 receptors**: Arousal, vigilance
- **Inverted-U**: Optimal NE → peak attention
  - **Too little**: Drowsiness, inattention, boredom
  - **Optimal**: Focused, alert, responsive

- **Stimulants** increase NE: Methylphenidate, amphetamines, modafinil

**Dopamine:**
- **Mesocortical Pathway** (VTA → PFC): Executive attention, working memory
- **Critical for goal-directed attention, cognitive flexibility**
- **D1 receptors** in PFC: Enhance persistent neuronal firing, maintain attention on task
- **Inverted-U**: Optimal dopamine → peak attention
  - **ADHD**: Low baseline dopamine → distractibility, poor sustained attention
  - **Stimulants** increase dopamine → improved focus
- **COMT Val158Met polymorphism**: Affects PFC dopamine clearance, attention performance

**Acetylcholine (ACh):**
- **Basal Forebrain (Nucleus Basalis of Meynert) → Cortex, Hippocampus**
- **Enhances sensory processing, selective attention**
- **Increases cortical responsiveness** to attended stimuli
- **Nicotinic receptors**: Enhance attention, processing speed (nicotine's cognitive effects)
- **Muscarinic receptors**: Learning, memory encoding
- **Deficiency**: Alzheimer's disease (severe attention deficits)

### Pathophysiology and Clinical Disorders

**1. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**

**Attention Deficits:**
- **Core symptoms**: Inattention, distractibility, difficulty sustaining focus
- **Impaired sustained attention**: Cannot maintain vigilance on boring tasks
- **Impaired selective attention**: Easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli
- **Executive attention deficits**: Poor goal-directed behavior, impulsivity

**Neurobiological Mechanisms:**
- **Reduced PFC and ACC dopamine and norepinephrine**
- **Hypoactivation** of dlPFC, ACC during attention tasks (fMRI)

## Research Data (Research-Focused)

### Norepinephrine and the Adaptive Gain Theory

**Aston-Jones and Cohen Model:**
- **Tonic LC-NE**: Baseline norepinephrine release from locus coeruleus
  - High tonic: Distractible, exploratory behavior (searching for new tasks)
  - Low tonic: Drowsy, disengaged
- **Phasic LC-NE**: Burst firing in response to task-relevant stimuli
  - Enhances signal-to-noise ratio in cortex
  - Improves detection of relevant information
- **Optimal performance**: Moderate tonic + robust phasic responses
  - Engaged but not overly aroused
  - Responsive to important stimuli

**Implications:**
- **ADHD**: Dysregulated LC-NE (low tonic, poor phasic responses)
- **Stress**: Excessive tonic NE → distractibility, anxiety
- **Stimulants**: Increase tonic and phasic NE → improved attention

### Default Mode Network and Attention

**Default Mode Network (DMN):**
- **Medial PFC, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus**
- **Active during rest, mind-wandering, self-referential thought**
- **Deactivates during focused attention tasks**

**DMN-Task Network Anticorrelation:**
- **Normal function**: DMN suppressed when task networks (dlPFC, parietal) activated
- **ADHD**: Reduced anticorrelation → DMN intrusions during tasks (mind-wandering)
- **Meditation**: Strengthens ability to suppress DMN, sustain attention

### Attention and Gamma Oscillations

**Gamma Waves (30-80 Hz):**
- **Synchronize neuronal firing** across attention networks
- **Enhance communication** between PFC, parietal cortex
- **Correlate with attention performance**: Higher gamma → better focus

**Parvalbumin (PV) Interneurons:**
- **Generate gamma oscillations** via fast inhibition
- **Schizophrenia**: Reduced PV interneurons → impaired gamma, attention deficits
- **NMDA receptor hypofunction**: Impairs PV function

### Genetic Influences on Attention

**DAT1 (Dopamine Transporter) Gene:**
- **10-repeat allele**: Associated with ADHD risk, reduced dopamine signaling
- **Treatment response**: May predict stimulant response

**COMT Val158Met:**
- **Val/Val**: Faster dopamine clearance → lower PFC dopamine, worse sustained attention
- **Met/Met**: Slower clearance → higher PFC dopamine, better sustained attention

**DRD4 (Dopamine D4 Receptor):**
- **7-repeat allele**: Associated with ADHD, novelty-seeking, reduced reward sensitivity

### Mindfulness and Attention Training

**Mindfulness Meditation:**
- **Sustained attention**: Enhances vigilance, reduces mind-wandering
- **Selective attention**: Improves filtering of distractors
- **Neural changes**: Increased PFC, ACC activation; reduced DMN activity

**Attention Training Programs:**
- **Attention Process Training (APT)**: Improves sustained, selective, divided attention (TBI rehab)
- **Working memory training**: Limited transfer to general attention (controversial)

## Summary

Attention and focus are complex cognitive functions involving multiple specialized neural networks including the alerting network (locus coeruleus norepinephrine system for arousal and vigilance), orienting network (parietal cortex and superior colliculus for spatial attention and attentional shifts), and executive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex for goal-directed attention and conflict monitoring). Multiple neurotransmitter systems contribute - norepinephrine (arousal, sustained attention, signal-to-noise enhancement), dopamine (executive attention, working memory, goal-directed behavior), acetylcholine (sensory processing, selective attention enhancement), and glutamate (fast excitatory transmission supporting attentional processing).

Attention deficits are prominent in ADHD (reduced PFC dopamine and norepinephrine, hypoactivation of executive control networks, default mode network intrusions), traumatic brain injury (diffuse axonal injury disrupting attention networks, mental fatigue, slowed processing speed), sleep deprivation (adenosine accumulation, reduced PFC activation, microsleeps and attentional lapses), age-related decline (reduced monoamines, white matter changes, frontal atrophy with preserved selective attention but impaired divided attention), and schizophrenia (mesocortical dopamine hypofunction, NMDA receptor deficits, impaired sensory gating). The inverted-U relationship applies to both norepinephrine and dopamine - optimal levels support peak attention performance while deficiency causes inattention and excess causes distractibility and anxiety.

Evidence-based supplements that support attention and focus include caffeine (alertness and sustained attention, 5/5), caffeine + L-theanine combination (synergistic focused attention without jitteriness, 5/5), Rhodiola rosea (mental fatigue reduction and stress-related attention enhancement, 4/5), Bacopa monnieri (sustained attention and processing speed, 4/5), and L-tyrosine (attention under stress and sleep deprivation, 4/5). Lifestyle interventions prioritizing adequate sleep (sleep deprivation equivalent to legal intoxication for attention impairment), regular aerobic exercise (increases BDNF and catecholamines), mindfulness meditation (strengthens sustained and selective attention networks while suppressing default mode network), minimizing multitasking (task-switching reduces efficiency by 40%), strategic breaks (Pomodoro technique for sustained attention), and creating distraction-free environments are foundational for maintaining optimal attention and focus throughout life. The default mode network's anticorrelation with task networks is critical for focused attention, with ADHD showing reduced suppression leading to mind-wandering during tasks.
