# Serum Iron

## Overview

Serum iron measures the iron currently being transported in the blood. It is almost always interpreted alongside **Ferritin** (storage iron) and **TIBC** (Total Iron Binding Capacity) to assess overall iron status. Levels fluctuate significantly throughout the day and with dietary intake.

## Clinical Significance

- **Low Serum Iron:** Iron deficiency anemia, chronic blood loss, pregnancy, chronic disease.
- **High Serum Iron:** Hemochromatosis, hemolytic anemia, iron poisoning, multiple blood transfusions.
