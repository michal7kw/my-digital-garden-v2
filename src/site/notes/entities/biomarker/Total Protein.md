# Total Protein

## Overview

Total protein levels in the blood are made up of two main classes: **Albumin** and **Globulin**. This test is used to evaluate overall health, nutritional status, and diseases of the liver, kidneys, or bone marrow.

## Clinical Significance

- **Low Total Protein:** Malnutrition, malabsorption (Celiac, IBD), liver disease, kidney disease (Nephrotic syndrome).
- **High Total Protein:** Chronic inflammation, infections (HIV, Hepatitis), multiple myeloma, dehydration.
