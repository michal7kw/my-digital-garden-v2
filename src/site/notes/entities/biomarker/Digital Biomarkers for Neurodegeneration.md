# Digital Biomarkers for Neurodegeneration

## Overview
Digital biomarkers represent a paradigm shift from episodic clinical assessments to continuous, real-world monitoring of neurological function. Using smartphones, wearables, and specialized sensors, these tools capture motor function (gait, tremor), cognition (typing patterns, app usage), speech, and behavior in natural settings. They promise earlier detection, more sensitive progression tracking, and reduced patient burden in clinical trials.

## Key Domains and Technologies

### Motor Function
| Modality | Measurement | Diseases | Technology |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Gait | Speed, stride, variability | PD, AD, MS | Smartphone accelerometer, smart insoles |
| Tremor | Frequency, amplitude | PD, ET | Smartwatch, accelerometer |
| Bradykinesia | Tap speed, movement amplitude | PD | Smartphone tap tests |
| Balance | Sway, fall risk | PD, MS | Wearable sensors |
| Fine motor | Typing patterns, drawing | PD, AD | Smartphone apps |

### Cognitive Function
| Modality | Measurement | Diseases | Technology |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|

| Semantic content | Language impairment | AD, FTD |
| Voice quality | Hypophonia | PD |
