# Neurofilament Light Chain

## Overview
Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) is a 68 kDa subunit of the neuronal cytoskeleton that provides structural support to axons. When neurons are damaged or degenerating, NfL is released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and subsequently into blood. Advances in ultrasensitive immunoassay technology (SIMOA) have enabled reliable blood-based measurement.

## Clinical Utility

### Diagnostic Applications
- **ALS**: Markedly elevated; helps distinguish from mimics
- **Multiple Sclerosis**: Elevated during relapses and progression
- **Alzheimer's Disease**: Elevated in symptomatic stages
- **Frontotemporal Dementia**: Strongly elevated; prognostic value
- **Huntington's Disease**: Elevated in premanifest carriers
- **Traumatic Brain Injury**: Acute elevation after injury

### Prognostic Value
- Correlates with disease severity and progression rate
- Predicts conversion from MCI to dementia
- Monitors treatment response in clinical trials

## Reference Ranges

| Age Group | Normal Range (Serum) | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| 18-40 years | <10 pg/mL | Normal |
| 40-60 years | <15 pg/mL | Normal |
| >60 years | <20 pg/mL | Normal |
| Elevated | 20-50 pg/mL | Mild neurodegeneration |
| High | >50 pg/mL | Active neurodegeneration |
| Very High | >100 pg/mL | Severe (ALS, acute injury) |

*Note: CSF levels are ~40x higher than serum*

## Factors Affecting Levels
- **Increased by**: Age, renal impairment, acute neurological injury
- **Disease-related**: Higher in faster-progressing diseases
- **Sampling**: Stable in blood; minimal diurnal variation

## Clinical Interpretation

### When to Order
1. Suspected motor neuron disease (ALS vs mimics)
2. Monitoring MS disease activity and progression
3. Research: Tracking neurodegeneration in clinical trials
4. Risk stratification in genetic neurodegenerative diseases

### Limitations
- Non-specific for etiology (many causes of elevation)
- Age-related increases require age-adjusted interpretation
- Not yet universally standardized across assay platforms
