# MTBR-tau243

## Overview
MTBR-tau243 is a novel tau biomarker comprising fragments from the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) of tau that are released specifically during neurofibrillary tangle formation and neurodegeneration. Unlike phospho-tau species (p-tau181, p-tau217) that reflect both amyloid-induced tau secretion and tangles, MTBR-tau is more specifically tied to tangles and disease progression. This may make it superior for tracking treatment response and predicting decline.

## Scientific Basis

### Tau Structure and Release
```
N-terminus ---- Mid-domain ---- MTBR ---- C-terminus
     ↓              ↓            ↓
 p-tau181      p-tau217      MTBR-tau243
     ↓              ↓            ↓
Soluble tau   Tau secretion   Tangle-derived
 (early)       (amyloid-      (neurodegeneration)
               induced)
```

### Why MTBR-tau Is Different
| Feature | p-tau181/217 | MTBR-tau243 |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Reflects | Tau phosphorylation, amyloid response | Tangle pathology, neurodegeneration |
| Elevation timing | Early (preclinical) | Later (with tangles) |
| Correlation with | Amyloid PET | Tau PET, atrophy |
| Prognosis | Moderate | Strong |
| Treatment tracking | May decrease with anti-amyloid | Reflects neuronal loss |

## Key Research Findings

### Barthélemy et al. (2020, Nature Medicine)
- First characterization of MTBR-tau species
- CSF MTBR-tau correlates with tau PET
- Distinguishes AD stages better than p-tau

### DIAN Cohort Studies
- Elevated later in disease than p-tau217
- Correlates with cognitive decline
- Predicts future atrophy

### Biomarker Staging
| Stage | p-tau217 | MTBR-tau243 | Clinical |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Preclinical (amyloid+) | Elevated | Normal-mild ↑ | Normal cognition |
| Prodromal MCI | Elevated | Elevated | Memory symptoms |
| AD dementia | Elevated | Highly elevated | Dementia |

## Clinical Applications

### Potential Advantages Over p-tau217
1. **Staging**: Distinguishes early from advanced disease
2. **Prognosis**: Stronger correlation with future decline
3. **Treatment monitoring**: Reflects ongoing neurodegeneration
4. **Tau-specific**: Less influenced by amyloid-only changes

### Proposed Uses
| Application | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Disease staging | Differentiates preclinical from symptomatic |
| Prognosis | Predicts rate of decline |
| Treatment trials | Outcome measure for anti-tau therapies |
| Treatment monitoring | Track neurodegeneration on anti-amyloid |

## Measurement

### Current Methods
- **IP-LC-MS/MS**: Immunoprecipitation + mass spectrometry
- Washington University protocols
- Research use only
- Technically demanding

### Challenges
- Mass spectrometry required (not immunoassay)
- Limited lab availability
- Standardization in progress
- Not yet FDA approved

### Emerging Platforms
- Immunoassays in development
- Potential for broader availability
- Clinical implementation years away

## Comparison: MTBR-tau vs p-tau217 vs t-tau

| Feature | p-tau217 | MTBR-tau243 | Total tau |
|---------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Best for | AD diagnosis | Staging, prognosis | General neurodegeneration |
| Specificity for AD | Very high | High | Low |
| Tangle correlation | Moderate | Strong | Moderate |
| Amyloid influence | Strong | Less | Minimal |
| Availability | Emerging clinical | Research only | Established |
