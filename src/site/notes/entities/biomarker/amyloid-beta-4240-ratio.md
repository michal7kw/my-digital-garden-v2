# Amyloid-Beta 42/40 Ratio

## Overview
The Amyloid-Beta 42/40 ratio compares the concentrations of the 42-amino acid form (Aβ42) to the 40-amino acid form (Aβ40) of amyloid-beta peptides. In Alzheimer's disease, Aβ42 is preferentially deposited in brain plaques, causing a decrease in CSF and plasma Aβ42 relative to Aβ40. The ratio is more reliable than Aβ42 alone as it corrects for individual variation in total amyloid production.

## Why Ratio Is Superior to Aβ42 Alone
1. **Controls for production variability**: Aβ40 reflects overall APP processing
2. **Reduces preanalytical variability**: Less affected by tube binding, handling
3. **Better discrimination**: Higher diagnostic accuracy for amyloid positivity
4. **Concordance with PET**: Better correlation with amyloid PET imaging

## Reference Values

### CSF Aβ42/40 Ratio
| Status | Ratio | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Normal | >0.089 | Amyloid negative |
| Reduced | <0.089 | Amyloid positive |
| Borderline | 0.085-0.089 | Consider PET confirmation |

*Cutoffs may vary by laboratory and assay platform*

### Plasma Aβ42/40 Ratio
- Platform-dependent; generally lower than CSF
- Emerging for screening; less sensitive than CSF
- Mass spectrometry methods show best performance

## ATN Framework Role
- **"A" Component**: Indicates amyloid pathology
- Combined with T (tau) and N (neurodegeneration) for staging
- A+ indicates AD pathological change regardless of symptoms

## Clinical Applications

### Diagnostic Use
1. **Symptomatic patients**: Confirms AD etiology of dementia/MCI
2. **Differential diagnosis**: Distinguishes AD from non-AD dementias
3. **Preclinical research**: Identifies at-risk individuals

### Prognostic Use
- Predicts conversion from MCI to AD dementia
- Correlates with future cognitive decline in cognitively normal individuals
- Amyloid positivity precedes symptoms by 15-20 years

## Sample Handling Considerations

### Preanalytical Factors
- Use polypropylene tubes (Aβ42 binds to polystyrene)
- Process within specified time windows
- Avoid freeze-thaw cycles
- Follow laboratory-specific protocols

### Diurnal Variation
- Minimal clinically significant variation
- Lumbar puncture timing flexible

## Anti-Amyloid Therapy Monitoring
- Ratio increases with successful amyloid-lowering treatment
- Used as surrogate endpoint in clinical trials
- Monitored alongside amyloid PET in treated patients
