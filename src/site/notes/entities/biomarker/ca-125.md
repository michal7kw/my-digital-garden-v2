# CA 125

## Overview
Cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), also known as mucin 16 (MUC16), is a high-molecular-weight transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of mesothelial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium. It is shed into the bloodstream when these surfaces are irritated or disrupted.

CA 125 is the most widely used biomarker for epithelial ovarian cancer, particularly serous carcinoma. It is primarily utilized for monitoring treatment response during chemotherapy, detecting recurrence after primary therapy, and in conjunction with transvaginal ultrasound for screening high-risk populations (e.g., BRCA1/2 carriers). A declining CA 125 during chemotherapy indicates treatment response, while rising levels may signal progression or recurrence.

CA 125 has significant limitations as a screening tool due to poor specificity. Elevated levels occur in numerous benign conditions including endometriosis, uterine fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, liver cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, and pleural effusions. Normal physiological states such as menstruation and early pregnancy can also cause transient elevations. Approximately 50% of early-stage ovarian cancers have normal CA 125 levels, further limiting its screening utility.

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Low** | <10 U/mL | Normal |
| **Normal** | <35 U/mL | Upper limit of normal for adults |
| **High** | 35-200 U/mL | May indicate benign condition or malignancy; clinical correlation needed |
| **Very High** | >200 U/mL | Strongly suggestive of malignancy, especially with adnexal mass |
| **Optimal** | <35 U/mL | Standard clinical threshold |

## Testing Information
