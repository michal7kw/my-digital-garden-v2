# GrimAge

## Overview
An advanced epigenetic clock that uses DNA methylation patterns to predict mortality and biological age.

## Reference Ranges
Reference ranges not available.

## Optimal Ranges
```yaml
'{"optimal": "< Chronological Age"}'
```

## Testing Information
- **Measurement Unit**: Not specified
- **Sample Type**: Blood
- **Fasting Required**: False
- **Recommended Test Frequency**: Annually or bi-annually

## Interpretation Guidelines
- GrimAge acceleration (GrimAge - Chronological Age) > 0 indicates faster biological aging.
- GrimAge acceleration < 0 indicates slower biological aging (longevity benefit).
