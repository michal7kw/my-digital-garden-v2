# Total Tau

## Overview
Total Tau (t-tau) measures all forms of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid, regardless of phosphorylation state. It reflects the intensity of neuronal damage and correlates with the rate of neurodegeneration. Unlike phospho-tau, which is relatively specific for AD pathology, t-tau is elevated in any condition causing significant neuronal injury.

## ATN Framework Role
- **"N" Component**: Marker of Neurodegeneration
- Non-specific for etiology (elevated in AD, stroke, CJD)
- Complements A (amyloid) and T (tau pathology) markers

## Reference Ranges

| Age Group | Normal (pg/mL) | Borderline | Elevated |
|-----------|----------------|------------|----------|
| <50 years | <300 | 300-400 | >400 |
| 50-70 years | <350 | 350-450 | >450 |
| >70 years | <400 | 400-500 | >500 |

*Note: Cutoffs vary by laboratory*

## Conditions Affecting T-Tau

### Chronic Elevation
- Alzheimer's disease (moderate elevation)
- Frontotemporal dementia (variable)
- Progressive supranuclear palsy

### Acute Elevation
- Stroke (peaks 2-3 days, returns to baseline)
- Traumatic brain injury (acute phase)
- Hypoxic brain injury
- Status epilepticus

### Marked Elevation
- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (very high, >1000 pg/mL)
- Acute encephalitis

## Relationships

### Conditions with Elevated T-Tau

- → [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease\|Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease]] (condition) - *Markedly elevated*
- → [[Stroke\|Stroke]] (condition) - *Acutely elevated*
- → [[Traumatic Brain Injury\|Traumatic Brain Injury]] (condition) - *Acute injury marker*

### Diagnostic Procedures
- ← [[entities/Examination/Lumbar Puncture\|Lumbar Puncture]] (examination) - *CSF collection*

## Clinical Interpretation

### Diagnostic Context
1. **AD workup**: Elevated t-tau supports neurodegeneration but not specific
2. **CJD suspicion**: Markedly elevated (>1000) with rapid dementia
3. **Acute brain injury**: Peaks acutely, then normalizes
4. **Prognosis**: Higher levels predict faster cognitive decline

### Limitations
- Non-specific; many causes of elevation
- Age-related increase in normal values
- Not useful for monitoring treatment response
- Blood-based t-tau less reliable than CSF

## Comparison: T-Tau vs P-Tau

| Feature | Total Tau | Phospho-Tau |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Specificity | Low (any neuronal injury) | High (tau pathology) |
| AD diagnosis | Supportive | Core marker |
| Acute elevation | Yes (stroke, TBI) | No |
| ATN role | N (neurodegeneration) | T (tau pathology) |
