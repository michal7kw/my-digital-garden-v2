# Acute Kidney Injury Markers

## Overview

Traditional markers of kidney function like **Creatinine** are often delayed in responding to acute injury. Novel protein biomarkers allow for earlier detection of **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**, often hours before creatinine rises.

## Key Markers

- **NGAL (Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin):** One of the most studied early markers.
- **KIM-1 (Kidney Injury Molecule-1):** Highly specific for tubular damage.
- **Cystatin C:** A more sensitive marker of GFR than creatinine.
- **IL-18 (Interleukin-18):** An inflammatory marker of AKI.
