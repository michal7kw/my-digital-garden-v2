# GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)

## Overview
Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) is the principal intermediate filament protein of astrocytes. When astrocytes are damaged or activated (reactive astrogliosis), GFAP is released into CSF and blood. GFAP is FDA-cleared for traumatic brain injury triage and is emerging as an important blood biomarker in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, reflecting astrocyte pathology and neuroinflammation.

## Biological Background

### Astrocyte Function
- Most abundant glial cell in CNS
- Support neurons, maintain BBB
- Regulate neurotransmitters and ions
- Immune and inflammatory responses

### GFAP Release
- Indicator of astrocyte damage or activation
- More brain-specific than S100B
- Remains elevated longer after injury
- Correlates with lesion size in TBI

## FDA-Cleared Application

### Traumatic Brain Injury (Abbott i-STAT)
- Combined GFAP + UCH-L1 test
- Rule out need for CT scan in mild TBI
- High NPV (99.6%) for intracranial lesions
- Results in ~15 minutes

### Cutoffs (Abbott Platform)
- GFAP + UCH-L1 combined algorithm
- Negative: CT scan not indicated
- Positive: Consider CT imaging

## GFAP in Neurodegeneration

### Alzheimer's Disease
- Elevated in AD compared to controls
- Increases with disease progression
- Correlates with amyloid and tau pathology
- May reflect reactive astrogliosis around plaques

### Compared to Other AD Biomarkers
| Biomarker | What It Reflects | AD Change |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| p-tau217 | Tau pathology | ↑↑↑ |
| Aβ42/40 | Amyloid | ↓↓ |
| NfL | Axonal damage | ↑↑ |
| GFAP | Astrocyte activation | ↑↑ |

### Added Value
- Different biological process (astrogliosis)
- Complements tau and amyloid markers
- May indicate neuroinflammatory component
- Predictive of progression

### Other Conditions with Elevated GFAP
- Frontotemporal dementia
- Multiple sclerosis (acute relapses)
- Neuromyelitis optica
- Stroke (acute phase)
- CNS tumors

## Clinical Performance in AD

### Diagnostic Accuracy
| Comparison | AUC | Notes |
|------------|-----|-------|
| AD vs controls | 0.80-0.88 | Moderate accuracy |
| Amyloid+ vs amyloid- | 0.75-0.85 | Somewhat predictive |
| MCI conversion prediction | 0.70-0.80 | Prognostic value |

### In Multi-Marker Panels
- Adds incremental value to p-tau217
- GFAP + p-tau217 + Aβ42/40 panels under study
- May improve sensitivity/specificity

- Freeze-thaw tolerant

### Timing After Injury (TBI)
- Peaks 24-48 hours post-injury
- Remains elevated for days
- Longer window than S100B

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- FDA-cleared for TBI (point-of-care)
