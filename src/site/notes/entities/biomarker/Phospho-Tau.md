# Phospho-Tau

## Overview
Phospho-Tau (p-tau) refers to tau protein phosphorylated at specific amino acid residues. In Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, detaches from microtubules, and aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles. CSF and plasma p-tau are now core biomarkers in the NIA-AA ATN (Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration) research framework.

## Key Phosphorylation Sites

| Epitope | Location | Clinical Utility |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| p-tau181 | Threonine 181 | Most established; FDA cleared |
| p-tau217 | Threonine 217 | Highest sensitivity/specificity |
| p-tau231 | Threonine 231 | Early changes; tracks amyloid |

## Clinical Applications

### Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis
- Distinguishes AD from non-AD dementias
- Predicts progression from MCI to AD dementia
- Reflects both amyloid and tau pathology

### ATN Framework Classification
- **A+T+N-**: Preclinical AD (biomarker positive, no neurodegeneration)
- **A+T+N+**: Full AD pathology with neurodegeneration
- **A-T+N+**: Non-AD tauopathy (PSP, CBD, etc.)

## Reference Values

### CSF P-Tau181
| Status | Range (pg/mL) | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Normal | <60 | No tau pathology |
| Borderline | 60-80 | Monitor clinically |
| Elevated | >80 | Tau pathology likely |

### Plasma P-Tau217 (Emerging)
| Status | Range (pg/mL) | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Normal | <0.5 | Low AD probability |
| Elevated | >0.5 | High AD probability |

## Advantages of Plasma P-Tau

### P-Tau217 Benefits
- Minimally invasive (blood draw)
- High concordance with CSF and PET
- Cost-effective screening
- Suitable for large-scale trials and population screening

### Current Limitations
- Requires specialized assay platforms
- Not yet universally available
- Standardization across labs ongoing

## Clinical Interpretation

### When to Order
1. Diagnostic workup for cognitive impairment
2. Differentiating AD from other dementias
3. Research: ATN classification for clinical trials
4. Monitoring anti-amyloid/anti-tau therapies

### Interpretation Notes
- Combine with amyloid markers (Aβ42/40 or amyloid PET)
- Consider clinical context (age, symptoms, MRI)
- P-tau alone does not diagnose AD; requires syndromic assessment
