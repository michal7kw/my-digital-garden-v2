# Creatine Kinase

## Overview

Creatine Kinase (CK), also known as phosphocreatine kinase, is released into the blood whenever there is muscle damage. It is a key marker for diagnosing muscle diseases and monitoring muscle injury.

## Isoenzymes

- **CK-MB:** Primarily in heart muscle (marker for myocardial infarction).
- **CK-MM:** Primarily in skeletal muscle.
- **CK-BB:** Primarily in the brain.

## Clinical Significance

- **Elevated CK:** Myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis, muscular dystrophy, strenuous exercise, statin-induced myopathy.
