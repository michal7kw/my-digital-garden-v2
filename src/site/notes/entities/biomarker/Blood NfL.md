# Blood NfL (Serum/Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain)

## Overview
Blood-based neurofilament light chain (NfL) measurement has been enabled by ultrasensitive immunoassay technology (SIMOA). Serum or plasma NfL correlates highly with CSF NfL (r~0.85-0.90) and provides a minimally invasive marker of ongoing neurodegeneration across multiple diseases. In 2024, the first FDA-cleared blood NfL test became available.

## Platform and Technology

### Ultrasensitive Immunoassays
| Platform | Manufacturer | Sensitivity | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| SIMOA HD-X | Quanterix | 0.038 pg/mL | Research gold standard |
| Ella | ProteinSimple | 0.1 pg/mL | Microfluidic |
| Lumipulse | Fujirebio | 1 pg/mL | Automated |
| Atellica | Siemens | 1.22 pg/mL | FDA cleared (2024) |

### Correlation with CSF
- r = 0.85-0.91 across studies
- Blood levels ~40x lower than CSF
- Similar clinical associations

## FDA Clearance (2024)

### Siemens Atellica IM NfL Assay
- First FDA-cleared blood NfL test
- Indicated as aid in evaluating neurological diseases
- Fully automated, high throughput
- Enables clinical implementation

## Reference Ranges

### Age-Dependent Normal Values
| Age (years) | 50th Percentile (pg/mL) | 95th Percentile |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| 20-40 | 7-10 | 15-20 |
| 40-60 | 10-15 | 20-25 |
| 60-80 | 15-22 | 25-40 |
| >80 | 20-30 | 35-60 |

*Values are approximate and platform-dependent*

## Clinical Applications by Disease

### Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
- **Strongly elevated** (often >100 pg/mL)
- Distinguishes from mimics
- Prognostic (higher = faster progression)
- FDA-cleared indication

### Multiple Sclerosis
- Elevated during relapses
- Tracks disease activity
- Predicts disability progression
- Treatment response marker

### Alzheimer's Disease
- Moderately elevated
- Correlates with rate of decline
- Adds to tau and amyloid markers
- Predicts progression in MCI

### Frontotemporal Dementia
- Strongly elevated
- Correlates with survival
- Tracks progression

### Parkinson's Disease
- Mildly elevated
- May predict faster progression
- Less pronounced than ALS/FTD

### Huntington's Disease
- Elevated even in premanifest carriers
- Tracks with clinical progression
- Potential trial outcome measure

## Clinical Utility Summary

### Strengths
| Application | Utility |
|-------------|---------|
| ALS diagnosis | High (distinguish mimics) |
| ALS prognosis | High (predicts survival) |
| MS activity | High (treatment monitoring) |
| AD staging | Moderate (progression) |
| FTD prognosis | High |
| General neurodegeneration | High (non-specific) |

### Limitations
- Non-specific (any cause of axonal damage)
- Age-dependent (need adjusted norms)
- Acute injury causes spikes
- Not disease-specific
- Renal impairment elevates levels

## Serial Monitoring

### Change Interpretation
- >20% change considered significant
- Intra-individual variation ~10-15%
- Useful for longitudinal tracking
- Treatment response assessment

### MS Monitoring Example
- Baseline before treatment
- Decrease with effective DMT
- Stable or rising = consider treatment change

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- FDA-cleared (2024)
- Blood draw (accessible)
- Pan-neurodegeneration marker
- Strong prognostic value
- Tracks treatment response (MS)

### Limitations
- Non-specific for disease
- Age adjustment required
- Confounded by peripheral neuropathy, renal disease
- Not standalone diagnostic

## Sample Considerations

### Collection
- Serum or plasma (platform-specific)
- Standard phlebotomy
- Stable analyte

### Stability
- Room temperature: 24-48 hours
- -80°C: Years
- Minimal freeze-thaw effect
