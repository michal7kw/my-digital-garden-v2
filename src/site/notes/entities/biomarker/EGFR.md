# EGFR Status

## Overview
**EGFR Status** is a critical predictive biomarker in oncology.
1.  **NSCLC (Lung Cancer)**: Testing for *sensitizing mutations* (e.g., Exon 19 deletion, L858R) determines eligibility for EGFR-TKI therapy (Gefitinib, Osimertinib).
2.  **Colorectal Cancer**: Testing for *expression* (IHC) is sometimes done, but lack of downstream RAS mutations is the primary driver for anti-EGFR antibody therapy (Cetuximab).

## Clinical Significance
- **Positive Mutation (Lung)**: Predicts response to EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.
- **T790M Mutation**: Mechanism of acquired resistance; indicates need for 3rd generation TKI (Osimertinib).
