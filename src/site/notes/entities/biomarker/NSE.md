# NSE (Neuron-Specific Enolase)

## Overview
Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) is the gamma-gamma isoform of the glycolytic enzyme enolase. It is highly expressed in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, making it a marker for both neuronal injury and neuroendocrine tumors. In neurology, NSE is used as a prognostic biomarker after cardiac arrest and hypoxic brain injury.

## Biological Background

### Expression
- **Neurons**: Cytoplasmic localization
- **Neuroendocrine cells**: Pancreatic islets, adrenal medulla
- **Neuroendocrine tumors**: SCLC, neuroblastoma, carcinoid

### Physiology
- Essential for glycolysis (2-phosphoglycerate → phosphoenolpyruvate)
- Half-life: ~24 hours
- Constitutively expressed, released upon cell damage

## Reference Values

| Level (ug/L) | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| <12.5 | Normal |
| 12.5-17 | Mildly elevated; correlate clinically |
| >17 | Elevated; suggests neuronal injury or tumor |
| >33 | After cardiac arrest: poor prognosis |

*Cutoffs for prognostication vary by study*

## Clinical Applications

### Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury
- **Cardiac arrest prognostication**: High NSE predicts poor neurological outcome
- **ERC/ESICM guidelines**: NSE >60 ug/L at 48-72h suggests poor prognosis
- **Must exclude hemolysis**: RBCs contain NSE (false elevation)

### Traumatic Brain Injury
- Correlates with injury severity
- Prognostic for outcome
- Less specific than newer markers (GFAP, UCH-L1)

### Tumor Marker
- **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)**: Diagnosis and monitoring
- **Neuroblastoma**: Staging and response assessment
- **Other neuroendocrine tumors**: Merkel cell, carcinoid

## Important Considerations

### Hemolysis Interference
- **Critical issue**: RBCs and platelets contain NSE
- Hemolyzed samples produce falsely elevated results
- Must measure hemolysis index and interpret cautiously
- Some guidelines require hemolysis <50 mg/dL

### Timing After Cardiac Arrest
- **Sample at 48-72 hours** post-arrest
- Single measurement insufficient; trend more informative
- Combine with other prognostic tools (EEG, imaging, clinical exam)

## Prognostication After Cardiac Arrest

### European Guidelines (ERC/ESICM 2021)
- NSE >60 ug/L at 48-72h suggests poor outcome
- Must be measured on at least two time points
- Exclude hemolysis
- Combine with other modalities (SSEPs, EEG, imaging)

### Multimodal Approach
NSE alone should not determine withdrawal of care:
1. Clinical examination (pupillary reflex, motor response)
2. Electrophysiology (SSEPs, EEG)
3. Neuroimaging (CT, MRI)
4. Biomarkers (NSE, +/- S100B)

## Comparison: NSE vs S100B

| Feature | NSE | S100B |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Source | Neurons | Astrocytes |
| Peak | 48-72 hours | 2-4 hours |
| Half-life | ~24 hours | ~2 hours |
| Hemolysis | Major confounder | Minor issue |
| Tumor use | Yes (SCLC) | Yes (melanoma) |
