# S100B

## Overview
S100B is a 21 kDa calcium-binding protein predominantly expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system. It is released into the bloodstream when brain tissue is damaged or when the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is compromised. S100B serves as an acute biomarker for brain injury and is used clinically to help rule out significant intracranial pathology after head trauma.

## Biological Roles

### Normal Physiology
- Calcium homeostasis in astrocytes
- Regulation of cell growth and differentiation
- Cytoskeletal dynamics
- Paracrine signaling to neurons

### Pathological Elevation
- Released during astrocyte damage or death
- Indicates BBB disruption
- At high concentrations, may contribute to neuroinflammation

## Clinical Applications

### Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
- **Screening tool**: Low S100B (<0.10 ug/L within 3h) suggests low risk of intracranial lesion
- **CT decision rule**: Can reduce unnecessary CT scans
- **Scandinavian Guidelines**: Incorporated into TBI management
- **Limitations**: Sensitivity ~95%, specificity ~30%

### Stroke
- Elevated within hours of ischemic stroke
- Correlates with infarct volume
- Prognostic for functional outcome

### Cardiac Surgery
- Marker of brain injury post-cardiopulmonary bypass
- Correlates with neurocognitive decline

## Reference Values

| Level (ug/L) | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| <0.10 | Normal; low risk of significant brain injury |
| 0.10-0.15 | Borderline; clinical correlation required |
| >0.15 | Elevated; suggests brain injury |
| >1.0 | Markedly elevated; significant injury |

*Cutoffs vary by assay and clinical context*

## Timing Considerations
- **Peak**: 2-4 hours after injury
- **Half-life**: ~2 hours in serum
- **Sampling window**: Optimal within 3-6 hours of injury
- **Late samples**: May miss acute elevation

## Extracranial Sources (False Positives)
- Trauma to extracranial tissues (fractures)
- Melanoma (S100B is tumor marker)
- Cardiac contusion
- Renal impairment (reduced clearance)
- Adipose tissue damage

## Comparison with GFAP

| Feature | S100B | GFAP |
|---------|-------|------|
| Specificity | Lower (extracranial sources) | Higher (brain-specific) |
| Half-life | ~2 hours | ~24 hours |
| Peak | 2-4 hours | 12-24 hours |
| CT decision aid | Yes (Scandinavian guidelines) | Emerging |
| FDA status | Not FDA cleared | FDA cleared for TBI |

## Clinical Decision Support

### TBI CT Decision Rule (Scandinavian)
If all criteria met, CT may be avoided:
1. S100B <0.10 ug/L (sampled within 3 hours)
2. GCS 14-15
3. No risk factors (anticoagulation, age >65, etc.)

### Limitations
- Extracranial injuries common in trauma
- Requires sampling within optimal window
- Not standalone diagnostic test
