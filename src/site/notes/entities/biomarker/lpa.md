# Lp A

## Overview

**Lipoprotein(a)**, or **Lp(a)**, is a unique lipoprotein particle. It is essentially an LDL ("bad cholesterol") particle that has a second protein, **apolipoprotein(a)** or apo(a), attached to it via a disulfide bridge.

Unlike LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) levels are determined almost entirely (>90%) by genetics (specifically the *LPA* gene) and are not significantly influenced by diet or lifestyle.

## Pathophysiology

Lp(a) is a "triple threat" for cardiovascular disease:
1.  **Atherogenic:** Like LDL, it can penetrate arterial walls and deposit cholesterol, forming plaque.
2.  **Pro-thrombotic:** The apo(a) protein is structurally similar to plasminogen but lacks enzymatic activity. It competes with plasminogen for binding sites, inhibiting clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) and promoting clot formation.
3.  **Pro-inflammatory:** It carries oxidized phospholipids (OxPL), which trigger inflammation in blood vessel walls.

## Clinical Significance

- **Independent Risk Factor:** Elevated Lp(a) is a causal risk factor for myocardial infarction (heart attack), ischemic stroke, and aortic valve stenosis.
- **Residual Risk:** Explains why some people have heart attacks despite having normal LDL cholesterol.
- **Testing:** Recommendations are shifting towards testing Lp(a) at least once in every adult's lifetime.

## Management

Lp(a) is notoriously difficult to lower.
- **Statins:** Do NOT lower Lp(a) and may slightly increase it.
- **PCSK9 Inhibitors:** Can reduce Lp(a) by 20-30%.
- **Niacin:** Lowers levels but did not show clinical benefit in trials.
- **Emerging Therapies:** Antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., Pelacarsen) and siRNAs (e.g., Olpasiran) in clinical trials show potent reductions >80%.
