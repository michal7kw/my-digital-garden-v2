# BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)

## Overview
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors. It plays a critical role in neuronal survival, differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and long-term potentiation (LTP) - the cellular basis of learning and memory. BDNF is synthesized primarily in the brain but also detected in peripheral blood.

## Biological Functions

### Neuroprotection
- Promotes survival of existing neurons
- Supports differentiation of new neurons (neurogenesis)
- Protects against excitotoxicity and oxidative stress

### Synaptic Plasticity
- Essential for long-term potentiation (LTP)
- Facilitates dendritic spine growth
- Modulates neurotransmitter release
- Required for memory consolidation

### Cognitive Function
- Hippocampal BDNF critical for memory
- Prefrontal BDNF supports executive function
- Decline associated with cognitive aging

## Blood BDNF Measurement

### Serum vs Plasma
| Specimen | Source | Typical Range | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Serum | Platelet release during clotting | 10-30 ng/mL | Higher, more variable |
| Plasma | Circulating BDNF | 100-500 pg/mL | Lower, may better reflect brain |

### Factors Affecting Levels
**Increase BDNF:**
- Aerobic exercise (robust effect)
- Cognitive stimulation
- Sunlight exposure
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Ketogenic diet
- Sleep

**Decrease BDNF:**
- Chronic stress
- Depression
- Aging
- Obesity
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Poor sleep

## Clinical Associations

### Low BDNF Associated With
- Major depressive disorder
- Alzheimer's disease
- Parkinson's disease
- Schizophrenia
- Bipolar disorder
- Eating disorders

### BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism
- **Val/Val**: Normal BDNF secretion
- **Val/Met or Met/Met**: Reduced activity-dependent secretion
- Associated with reduced hippocampal volume
- May affect antidepressant response

## Clinical Interpretation

### When to Consider
1. Research context (neuroplasticity studies)
2. Treatment response monitoring (exercise, antidepressants)
3. Risk assessment for cognitive decline

### Limitations
- High inter-individual variability
- Platelet BDNF complicates serum interpretation
- No established clinical cutoffs
- Exercise timing affects levels (acute spike)

## Strategies to Optimize BDNF

1. **Regular aerobic exercise**: 30-45 min, 3-5x/week
2. **Quality sleep**: 7-9 hours, consistent schedule
3. **Stress management**: Meditation, nature exposure
4. **Cognitive challenge**: Learning, mental engagement
5. **Nutrition**: Omega-3s, polyphenols, avoid processed foods
6. **Sunlight**: Morning light exposure
