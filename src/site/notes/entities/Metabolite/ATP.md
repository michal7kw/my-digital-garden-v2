# ATP

## Overview

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the universal energy currency of all living cells, providing the energy for virtually all cellular processes including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, protein synthesis, active transport, and biosynthetic reactions.

ATP stores energy in its high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. When hydrolyzed to ADP and phosphate, approximately 30.5 kJ/mol of free energy is released to drive otherwise unfavorable reactions.

## ATP Production Pathways

| Pathway | Location | ATP Yield | Speed |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| [[entities/pathway/Oxidative Phosphorylation\|Oxidative Phosphorylation]] | Mitochondria | ~26-28/glucose | Slow but efficient |
| [[entities/pathway/Glycolysis\|Glycolysis]] | Cytoplasm | 2/glucose | Fast |
| [[entities/pathway/Citric Acid Cycle\|Citric Acid Cycle]] | Mitochondria | 2 GTP/glucose | Slow |
| [[entities/drug/Creatine\|Creatine]]-Phosphocreatine | Cytoplasm | Regenerates | Immediate |
