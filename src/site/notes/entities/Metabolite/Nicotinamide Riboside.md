# Nicotinamide Riboside

## Overview

Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring form of vitamin B3 and a highly efficient precursor to NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Unlike other forms of vitamin B3 (niacin and nicotinamide), NR can be directly phosphorylated to NMN and converted to NAD+ through a two-step enzymatic process.

NR is found naturally in milk (particularly cow's milk), yeast, and trace amounts in beer. However, dietary intake typically provides insufficient amounts for significant NAD+ elevation, leading to interest in NR supplementation for its potential health benefits.

Research interest in NR increased dramatically after studies demonstrated its ability to increase NAD+ levels and improve metabolic parameters in animal models, including protection against metabolic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and age-related decline.

## Mechanism of Action

### NAD+ Biosynthesis Pathway

NR enters cells through equilibrative nucleoside transporters and is converted to NAD+ via:

1. **Step 1**: NR + ATP → NMN + ADP (catalyzed by NRK1/NRK2)
2. **Step 2**: NMN + ATP → NAD+ + PPi (catalyzed by NMNATs)

### Advantages of NR as NAD+ Precursor

- **Bypasses NAMPT**: Unlike nicotinamide, NR doesn't require the rate-limiting enzyme NAMPT
- **No Flushing**: Unlike niacin, NR doesn't cause vasodilation and flushing
- **Oral Bioavailability**: Efficiently absorbed and converted to NAD+ in multiple tissues
- **Tissue Distribution**: Elevates NAD+ in liver, muscle, brain, and other tissues

## Research Summary

### Human Clinical Trials

- **PMID: 29184669** - Trammell et al. (2016): Single-dose NR safely elevated blood NAD+ metabolome in healthy humans
- **PMID: 30088436** - Martens et al. (2018): 1000mg/day NR for 6 weeks elevated NAD+ and improved cardiovascular parameters in middle-aged adults
- **PMID: 32386566** - Elhassan et al. (2019): 1g/day NR increased NAD+ in skeletal muscle and reduced inflammatory cytokines

### Preclinical Evidence

- Improved mitochondrial function in models of metabolic disease
- Protected against neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease models
- Extended healthspan in aging mice
- Improved insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet models

## Clinical Significance

- **Aging**: NAD+ declines with age; NR may restore youthful NAD+ levels
- **Metabolic Health**: Potential benefits for insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism
- **Neuroprotection**: May support brain health through NAD+-dependent mechanisms
- **Exercise Recovery**: May enhance mitochondrial function in muscle
