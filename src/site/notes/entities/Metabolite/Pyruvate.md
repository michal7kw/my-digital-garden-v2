# Pyruvate

## Overview

Pyruvate is the three-carbon organic acid produced as the final product of glycolysis. It represents one of the most important metabolic branch points in cellular biochemistry, determining whether glucose-derived carbons are fully oxidized for ATP production, fermented to lactate, or redirected toward biosynthetic pathways.

The fate of pyruvate depends critically on:
- Oxygen availability
- Cellular energy demands
- Mitochondrial function
- Hormonal signals

In healthy aerobic conditions, most pyruvate enters the mitochondria for complete oxidation, yielding approximately 30 additional ATP molecules beyond the 2 ATP produced by glycolysis.

## Metabolic Fates

### 1. Oxidative Decarboxylation (Aerobic)
- **Enzyme**: Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)
- **Product**: Acetyl-CoA + CO₂ + NADH
- **Location**: Mitochondrial matrix
- **Regulation**: Inhibited by acetyl-CoA, NADH; activated by NAD+, CoA

### 2. Lactate Fermentation (Anaerobic)
- **Enzyme**: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
- **Product**: Lactate + NAD+
- **Purpose**: Regenerates NAD+ for continued glycolysis
- **Examples**: Exercising muscle, red blood cells

### 3. Gluconeogenesis
- **Enzyme**: Pyruvate carboxylase
- **Product**: Oxaloacetate
- **Location**: Mitochondria, then cytosol
- **Purpose**: Glucose synthesis during fasting

### 4. Transamination
- **Enzyme**: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
- **Product**: Alanine
- **Purpose**: Amino acid synthesis, nitrogen transport

## Clinical Significance

### Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- Genetic disorder preventing pyruvate oxidation
- Results in lactic acidosis
- Neurological impairment due to brain's glucose dependence

### Warburg Effect
- Cancer cells preferentially convert pyruvate to lactate
- Even in presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis)
- Supports rapid proliferation and biosynthesis

### Thiamine Deficiency (Beriberi)
- PDH requires thiamine pyrophosphate
- Deficiency impairs pyruvate oxidation
- Leads to neurological and cardiac symptoms
