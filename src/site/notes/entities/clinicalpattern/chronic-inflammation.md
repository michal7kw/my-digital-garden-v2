# Chronic Inflammation

## Overview

Chronic Inflammation is a persistent, low-grade inflammatory state that accelerates aging and increases risk of multiple chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. It is a key driver of the "inflammaging" phenomenon.

Evidence Level: 4/5 (Strong epidemiological and mechanistic evidence)
Risk Multiplier: 1.5x for cardiovascular events

## Key Biomarkers

- **hs-CRP**: Primary inflammatory marker (> 3 mg/L high cardiovascular risk)
- **ESR**: General inflammation (> 20 mm/hr elevated)
- **Homocysteine**: Vascular inflammation (> 10 umol/L elevated)
- **Fibrinogen**: Clotting factor elevated in inflammation
