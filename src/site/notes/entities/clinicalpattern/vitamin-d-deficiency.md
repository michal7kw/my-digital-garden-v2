# Vitamin D Deficiency

## Overview

Vitamin D deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies, affecting an estimated 1 billion people worldwide. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and may protect against various chronic diseases.

Evidence Level: 4/5 (Strong epidemiological evidence)
Risk Multiplier: 1.2x for bone and immune-related conditions

## Key Biomarker

- **25-OH Vitamin D**: Primary measure of vitamin D status
  - Deficient: < 20 ng/mL
  - Insufficient: 20-29 ng/mL
  - Sufficient: 30-50 ng/mL
  - Optimal: 40-60 ng/mL

## Vitamin D Status Classification

| Level (ng/mL) | Status | Action |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| < 12 | Severe deficiency | High-dose supplementation |
| 12-20 | Deficient | Supplementation required |
| 20-30 | Insufficient | Supplementation recommended |
| 30-50 | Sufficient | Maintain current intake |
| 50-100 | High normal | May reduce supplementation |
| > 100 | Potentially toxic | Reduce/stop supplementation |
