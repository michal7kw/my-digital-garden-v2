# Cortisol

## Overview
Primary glucocorticoid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that regulates stress response, metabolism, immune function, and circadian rhythm. Essential for life but chronically elevated levels contribute to numerous health problems.

## Production
- **Site**: Adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata)
- **Hormone Class**: Steroid
- **Regulation**: Controlled by ACTH and CRH

## Functions
- Mobilizes glucose via gluconeogenesis
- Regulates stress response
- Suppresses immune function
- Maintains blood pressure
- Regulates metabolism
- Affects mood and cognition

## Target Organs
- Liver
- Muscle
- Adipose tissue
- Immune cells
- Brain
- Bone

## Reference Ranges
| Time | Range |
|------|-------|
| Morning | 6-23 mcg/dL |
| Evening | 3-16 mcg/dL |

## Circadian Pattern
Peaks in early morning (6-8 AM), lowest at midnight (cortisol awakening response)
