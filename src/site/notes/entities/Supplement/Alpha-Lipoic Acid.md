# Alpha-Lipoic Acid

## Overview
Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring organosulfur compound synthesized in mitochondria. Unlike most antioxidants, ALA is both water-soluble and fat-soluble, allowing it to work in all cellular compartments. It serves as a cofactor for mitochondrial enzymes and is a powerful antioxidant that regenerates other antioxidants including vitamins C, E, and glutathione.

## Forms

### R-Alpha Lipoic Acid (R-ALA)
- Natural, biologically active form
- Better absorbed and utilized
- More expensive
- Typical dose: 150-300 mg/day

### S-Alpha Lipoic Acid (S-ALA)
- Synthetic mirror image
- Less biologically active
- Found in racemic supplements

### Racemic (50:50 R/S)
- Most common supplement form
- Typical dose: 300-600 mg/day
- Cheaper than pure R-ALA

## Mechanisms of Action

1. **Antioxidant**: Directly scavenges ROS and RNS
2. **Antioxidant Recycling**: Regenerates glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E
3. **Metal Chelation**: Binds copper, iron, cadmium
4. **Mitochondrial Cofactor**: Essential for PDH and α-KGDH
5. **Glucose Uptake**: Enhances GLUT4 translocation
6. **NF-κB Inhibition**: Anti-inflammatory effects
7. **Nrf2 Activation**: Upregulates antioxidant enzymes

## Clinical Evidence

### Strong Evidence
- **Diabetic Neuropathy**: 600 mg/day IV or oral reduces symptoms (ALADIN, SYDNEY trials)
- **Reduces neuropathic pain**: Burning, stabbing, numbness

### Moderate Evidence
- **Cognitive function**: May improve mild cognitive impairment
- **Weight loss**: Modest effects at high doses (1800 mg/day)
- **Blood glucose**: Improves insulin sensitivity

### Emerging Evidence
- Neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD)
- Multiple sclerosis
- Migraine prophylaxis

## Dosage Guidelines

| Indication | Dose | Form | Notes |
|------------|------|------|-------|
| General antioxidant | 100-300 mg/day | Racemic or R-ALA | With food |
| Diabetic neuropathy | 600 mg/day | Racemic | Empty stomach |
| Cognitive support | 300-600 mg/day | R-ALA preferred | Divided doses |
| Neuroprotection | 600-1200 mg/day | R-ALA | Medical supervision |

### Timing
- Empty stomach for best absorption
- May cause GI upset; can take with food if needed
- R-ALA less stable; refrigerate

## Safety Profile

### Common Side Effects
- Nausea (especially high doses or empty stomach)
- Skin rash (rare)
- Hypoglycemia (diabetics on medications)

### Contraindications
- Thiamine (B1) deficiency - ALA may worsen
- Caution with hypoglycemic medications
- Pregnancy/lactation (limited data)

### Drug Interactions
- **Diabetes medications**: May enhance hypoglycemia
- **Thyroid medications**: May affect thyroid hormone levels
- **Chemotherapy**: Antioxidant interaction (theoretical)

## Quality Considerations

### Look For
- R-ALA or clearly labeled racemic
- Stabilized R-ALA formulations (Na-RALA, K-RALA)
- GMP-certified manufacturer
- Third-party testing

### Storage
- R-ALA is heat and light sensitive
- Store in cool, dark place
- Refrigeration may extend shelf life
