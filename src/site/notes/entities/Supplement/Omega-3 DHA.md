# Omega-3 DHA

## Overview
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a 22-carbon omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that comprises approximately 30-40% of the fatty acids in brain gray matter. It is essential for brain development during fetal and infant life and continues to support cognitive function throughout adulthood. DHA cannot be synthesized efficiently from plant-based precursors (ALA), making dietary intake crucial.

## Biological Roles

### Structural Component
- Primary omega-3 in brain and retina
- Provides membrane fluidity and flexibility
- Enables neurotransmitter receptor function
- Concentrated in synaptic membranes

### Neuroprotection
- Precursor to neuroprotectins (NPD1)
- Anti-inflammatory in brain
- Reduces amyloid-beta accumulation
- Supports BDNF expression

### Neurotransmission
- Enhances dopamine and serotonin function
- Supports acetylcholine transmission
- Modulates ion channel activity

## Sources

### Marine Sources (Direct DHA)
| Source | DHA Content | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel) | 500-1500 mg/serving | Also EPA |
| Fish oil supplements | 120-500 mg/capsule | Variable ratios |
| Krill oil | Lower DHA; phospholipid form | Better absorption |
| Algae oil | 200-500 mg/serving | Vegan source |

### Plant Sources (ALA → DHA conversion)
- Flaxseed, chia, walnuts provide ALA
- Conversion to DHA is <5% in most people
- Not reliable for DHA needs

## Clinical Evidence

### Brain Development
- Essential during pregnancy and infancy
- Higher maternal DHA → better child cognitive outcomes
- Added to infant formula

### Age-Related Cognitive Decline
- MIDAS trial: 900 mg/day improved memory in adults with MCI
- Observational data: Fish consumption protective
- RCTs mixed; may depend on baseline status

### Depression and Mood
- Low DHA associated with depression
- Adjunct to antidepressants may enhance effect
- Best evidence for high-EPA formulas

### Alzheimer's Disease
- Lower brain DHA levels in AD
- May slow decline in early stages (APOE4 negative)
- Prevention > treatment

## Dosage Guidelines

| Goal | DHA Dose | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| General brain health | 250-500 mg/day | With EPA |
| Cognitive optimization | 500-1000 mg DHA/day | Higher DHA ratio |
| Pregnancy | 200-300 mg DHA/day | Minimum recommendation |
| Depression adjunct | 1-2 g EPA+DHA | EPA-dominant formula |
| Age-related decline | 900 mg DHA/day | MIDAS trial dose |

### EPA:DHA Ratio
- Brain health: Higher DHA preferred (1:2 or more)
- Inflammation/mood: Higher EPA may be better
- Combined benefits from both

## Safety Profile

### Generally Very Safe
- GRAS status for supplements
- Few side effects at recommended doses

### Possible Side Effects
- Fishy burps (enteric coating helps)
- Loose stools at high doses
- Possible increased bleeding time

### Cautions
- **Anticoagulants**: Monitor at >3g/day combined EPA+DHA
- **Surgery**: May discontinue 1-2 weeks prior
- **Fish allergy**: Use algae-derived DHA

### Quality Concerns
- Oxidation (check TOTOX values)
- Heavy metals (mercury, PCBs)
- Look for third-party testing (IFOS, ConsumerLab)

## Omega-3 Index

### Optimal Target
- **Omega-3 Index**: 8-12% (of RBC membrane fatty acids)
- <4%: Very low (most Westerners)
- 4-8%: Moderate
- >8%: Associated with lower cardiovascular and cognitive risk

### Testing
- Blood spot or venous sample
- Reflects 3-month average intake
- Useful for personalizing dose
