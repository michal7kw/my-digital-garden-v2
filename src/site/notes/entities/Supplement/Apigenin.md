# Apigenin

## Overview
Apigenin is a widely distributed flavonoid found in plants like chamomile, parsley, and celery. It has garnered significant attention for its potential to promote longevity, improve sleep, and reduce anxiety.

Its primary mechanisms include:
1.  **CD38 Inhibition**: Apigenin is a potent inhibitor of CD38, an enzyme that degrades NAD+. By inhibiting CD38, it helps restore intracellular NAD+ levels, which are critical for mitochondrial function and cellular repair.
2.  **GABA Modulation**: It exerts sedative and anxiolytic effects by modulating GABA(A) receptors, acting similarly to a mild benzodiazepine but without the same risk of dependency.
3.  **Anti-inflammatory**: It reduces oxidative stress and inflammation by inhibiting key pathways like COX-2 and NF-κB.
