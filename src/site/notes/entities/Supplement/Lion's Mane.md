# Lion's Mane

## Overview
Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus) is an edible and medicinal mushroom native to North America, Europe, and Asia. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Modern research has identified unique compounds (hericenones and erinacines) that can cross the blood-brain barrier and stimulate nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, making it of significant interest for neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement.

## Active Compounds

### Hericenones (A-H)
- Found in the fruiting body (mushroom)
- Stimulate NGF synthesis in astrocytes
- Low molecular weight; cross BBB

### Erinacines (A-I)
- Found in the mycelium
- More potent NGF-stimulating activity
- Erinacine A most studied
- Promote BDNF expression

## Mechanisms of Action

1. **NGF Stimulation**: Increases nerve growth factor production in brain
2. **BDNF Enhancement**: Upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor
3. **Neurogenesis**: Promotes hippocampal neurogenesis
4. **Myelination Support**: May enhance myelin sheath formation
5. **Anti-inflammatory**: Reduces neuroinflammation
6. **Antioxidant**: Scavenges free radicals

## Research Evidence

### Human Studies
- **Cognitive improvement in MCI**: 3g/day for 16 weeks improved cognitive function scores (Mori 2009)
- **Depression and anxiety**: Reduced symptoms in menopausal women (Nagano 2010)
- **Limited dementia data**: More research needed

### Animal Studies (Strong)
- Promotes hippocampal neurogenesis
- Accelerates nerve regeneration after injury
- Reduces amyloid-beta plaques in AD models
- Improves memory in aged mice

## Dosage Guidelines

| Form | Typical Dose | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Fruiting body powder | 1000-3000 mg/day | Hericenones |
| Mycelium extract | 500-1000 mg/day | Erinacines (more potent) |
| Dual extract | 500-2000 mg/day | Both compounds |
| 1:1 extract | 1000 mg/day | Concentrated |

### Timing
- Can be taken with or without food
- Morning or divided doses
- Effects may take 2-4 weeks to notice

## Safety Profile

### Generally Well Tolerated
- Few reported side effects
- Occasional GI discomfort
- Rare allergic reactions (mushroom allergy)

### Contraindications
- Mushroom allergy
- Immunomodulation (theoretical concern with autoimmune disease)
- Surgery (discontinue 2 weeks prior due to antiplatelet effects)

### Drug Interactions
- May enhance effects of anticoagulants (theoretical)
- No major known interactions

## Quality Considerations

### Look For
- Beta-glucan content specified
- Dual extraction (water + alcohol)
- Fruiting body AND/OR mycelium (know which)
- Third-party testing

### Avoid
- Products with only "mycelium on grain" (mostly starch)
- No potency standardization
- No testing documentation
