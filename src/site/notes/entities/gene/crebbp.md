# CREBBP

## Overview
The **CREBBP** gene (also known as CBP) encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional coactivator. It binds to the phosphorylated form of the CREB transcription factor (cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein). It possesses intrinsic **histone acetyltransferase (HAT)** activity, relaxing chromatin structure to facilitate gene expression.

Mutations in CREBBP are associated with **Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome** and various cancers (lymphoma).
