# FOXO3

## Overview

The **FOXO3** gene encodes a transcription factor that functions as a master switch for cellular resilience. It translates environmental signals (like nutrient scarcity or oxidative stress) into gene expression programs that promote survival.

FOXO3 variants are consistently found in **centenarians** across diverse ethnic groups, making it one of the most validated "longevity genes" in humans.

## Biological Functions

### 1. Stress Resistance
Upregulates antioxidant enzymes (e.g., Manganese Superoxide Dismutase **SOD2**, Catalase) to neutralize ROS.

### 2. Proteostasis
Induces autophagy genes (e.g., *LC3*, *BNIP3*) to clear damaged proteins and organelles.

### 3. Cell Cycle & Apoptosis
Induces cell cycle arrest (via *p27*) to allow time for repair. If damage is too severe, it can trigger apoptosis (via *Bim*).

## Regulation (The "See-Saw")

FOXO3 activity is negatively regulated by insulin/growth factor signaling.
- **High Insulin/IGF-1:** Activates **AKT**, which phosphorylates FOXO3. This keeps FOXO3 trapped in the cytoplasm (inactive) and targets it for degradation.
- **Low Insulin/Fasting:** AKT is inactive. FOXO3 enters the nucleus to drive stress resistance genes.
