# PSEN1

## Overview
The **PSEN1** gene encodes **Presenilin-1**. Mutations in this gene are responsible for the majority of Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) cases, often causing onset before age 50. These mutations typically shift enzyme activity to produce more of the aggregation-prone Aβ42 peptide relative to Aβ40.
