# MAPT

## Overview
The **MAPT** gene encodes **Tau**, a protein that stabilizes microtubules in neurons. Alternative splicing yields 6 main isoforms in the adult human brain (3R and 4R types).

While Tau aggregates are a hallmark of Alzheimer's, mutations in the MAPT gene itself typically cause **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)** and other "tauopathies," not Alzheimer's disease.
