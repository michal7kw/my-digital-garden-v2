# PIK3R1

## Overview

The **PIK3R1** gene encodes the **p85alpha** regulatory subunit of Class IA Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). This protein is a critical gatekeeper for the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

p85alpha binds to the catalytic subunit (p110) to stabilize it and keep it inactive until a growth factor signal (like insulin) is received. Upon stimulation, p85alpha recruits the PI3K complex to the cell membrane, initiating the signaling cascade.

## Biological Functions

### 1. Insulin Signaling Regulation
p85alpha binds to phosphorylated Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS-1), recruiting PI3K to the membrane. This triggers the production of PIP3, activation of AKT, and subsequent glucose uptake (via GLUT4).
- **Metabolic Control:** Essential for glucose homeostasis in liver, muscle, and fat.

### 2. Tumor Suppression
By normally inhibiting the catalytic activity of p110 in the absence of growth factors, PIK3R1 prevents uncontrolled cell growth. Loss of function or specific mutations can lead to constitutive PI3K activation.

## Clinical Significance

- **SHORT Syndrome:** A rare autosomal dominant condition caused by specific PIK3R1 mutations.
    - **S**hort stature
    - **H**yperextensibility of joints
    - **O**cular depression (deep-set eyes)
    - **R**ieger anomaly
    - **T**eething delay
    - *Key Feature:* Severe insulin resistance and lipodystrophy.
- **Cancer:** Somatic mutations are found in endometrial, colon, and breast cancers. These often disrupt the inhibitory interaction between p85 and p110, leading to hyperactive signaling.
