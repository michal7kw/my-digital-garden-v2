# EP300

## Overview

The **EP300** gene encodes the **p300** protein, a transcriptional co-activator and Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT). It functions as a crucial epigenetic regulator, modifying chromatin structure to allow for gene expression.

p300 works in close association with **CBP (CREB-binding protein)**, and they are often referred to collectively as the p300/CBP family. Together, they regulate cell growth, differentiation, and DNA repair by acetylating histones and non-histone proteins (like p53).

## Biological Functions

### 1. Histone Acetylation
p300 adds acetyl groups to lysine residues on histone tails (H3, H4). This neutralizes the positive charge of histones, loosening the DNA-histone interaction and making chromatin accessible to transcription factors (open chromatin or euchromatin).

### 2. Transcriptional Co-activation
It acts as a bridge (scaffold) connecting DNA-bound transcription factors (like CREB, p53, HIF-1alpha) to the basal transcription machinery, facilitating gene expression.

## Clinical Significance

- **Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome (RSTS):** Heterozygous germline mutations in EP300 cause RSTS Type 2 (Type 1 is caused by CREBBP). Features include intellectual disability, broad thumbs/toes, and craniofacial abnormalities.
- **Cancer:** p300 can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context. Somatic mutations are found in various epithelial cancers.
- **Viral Interaction:** The protein was originally identified by its binding to the E1A oncoprotein of Adenovirus, which inhibits p300 function to drive viral replication.
