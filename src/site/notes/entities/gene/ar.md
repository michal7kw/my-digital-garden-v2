# AR

## Overview
The **AR** gene encodes the **Androgen Receptor**, a nuclear receptor superfamily member. Upon binding androgenic hormones (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone), it translocates to the nucleus and regulates the expression of genes involved in male sexual development and maintenance.

Mutations in this gene are associated with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) and Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (Kennedy's disease). It is a key driver and therapeutic target in **Prostate Cancer**.
