# APP

## Overview
The **APP** gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein basis of the **amyloid plaques** found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease.
