<h1>APP</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>APP</strong> gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein basis of the <strong>amyloid plaques</strong> found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease.</p>
