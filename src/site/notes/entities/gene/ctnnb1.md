# CTNNB1

## Overview
The **CTNNB1** gene encodes **Beta-Catenin**, a protein with two distinct roles:
1.  **Adhesion**: Links Cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton.
2.  **Signaling**: The key downstream effector of the **Wnt signaling pathway**.

Mutations in CTNNB1 that prevent its degradation lead to its accumulation and constitutive activation of Wnt target genes, a driver in colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and others.
