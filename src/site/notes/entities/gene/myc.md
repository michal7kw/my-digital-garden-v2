# "MYC"

## Overview

**MYC** (c-Myc) is a "master regulator" transcription factor that controls the expression of an estimated 15% of all genes. It promotes cell growth, cell cycle progression, and metabolism (glycolysis, mitochondrial biogenesis).

It is a proto-oncogene, meaning normal expression is tightly controlled and essential for life, but overexpression drives cancer. MYC is upregulated in **>50% of human cancers**, often making tumors "MYC-addicted" for their survival.

## Biological Functions

### 1. Transcriptional Activation
MYC heterodimerizes with **MAX** to bind E-box DNA sequences (CACGTG). It recruits histone acetyltransferases (like **p300/CBP**) to open chromatin and drive gene transcription.

### 2. Cell Cycle Entry
It is an "immediate early gene" activated by mitogens. It pushes cells from G0 (resting) into the cell cycle by upregulating Cyclins (D2, E) and repressing p21.

### 3. Metabolic Reprogramming
MYC drives the **Warburg Effect**, shifting metabolism towards glycolysis and glutaminolysis to provide building blocks for rapid cell division.

## Clinical Significance

- **Burkitt's Lymphoma:** The classic example of MYC dysregulation. A chromosomal translocation t(8;14) places MYC next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (IGH), causing massive overexpression.
- **Solid Tumors:** Amplification or "Super-Enhancer" activation of MYC drives breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancers.
- **Drug Target:** Directly targeting MYC has been difficult ("undruggable") due to its lack of a deep binding pocket. Strategies focus on inhibiting its transcription (BET inhibitors) or destabilizing the protein.
