<h1>&quot;MYC&quot;</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>MYC</strong> (c-Myc) is a &quot;master regulator&quot; transcription factor that controls the expression of an estimated 15% of all genes. It promotes cell growth, cell cycle progression, and metabolism (glycolysis, mitochondrial biogenesis).</p>
<p>It is a proto-oncogene, meaning normal expression is tightly controlled and essential for life, but overexpression drives cancer. MYC is upregulated in <strong>&gt;50% of human cancers</strong>, often making tumors &quot;MYC-addicted&quot; for their survival.</p>
<h2>Biological Functions</h2>
<h3>1. Transcriptional Activation</h3>
<p>MYC heterodimerizes with <strong>MAX</strong> to bind E-box DNA sequences (CACGTG). It recruits histone acetyltransferases (like <strong>p300/CBP</strong>) to open chromatin and drive gene transcription.</p>
<h3>2. Cell Cycle Entry</h3>
<p>It is an &quot;immediate early gene&quot; activated by mitogens. It pushes cells from G0 (resting) into the cell cycle by upregulating Cyclins (D2, E) and repressing p21.</p>
<h3>3. Metabolic Reprogramming</h3>
<p>MYC drives the <strong>Warburg Effect</strong>, shifting metabolism towards glycolysis and glutaminolysis to provide building blocks for rapid cell division.</p>
<h2>Clinical Significance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burkitt's Lymphoma:</strong> The classic example of MYC dysregulation. A chromosomal translocation t(8;14) places MYC next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (IGH), causing massive overexpression.</li>
<li><strong>Solid Tumors:</strong> Amplification or &quot;Super-Enhancer&quot; activation of MYC drives breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancers.</li>
<li><strong>Drug Target:</strong> Directly targeting MYC has been difficult (&quot;undruggable&quot;) due to its lack of a deep binding pocket. Strategies focus on inhibiting its transcription (BET inhibitors) or destabilizing the protein.</li>
