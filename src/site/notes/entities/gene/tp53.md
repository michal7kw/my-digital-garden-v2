# TP53

## Overview

**TP53** is arguably the most important tumor suppressor gene in the human genome, often referred to as the **"Guardian of the Genome."** It encodes the protein **p53**, a transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle and protects genomic stability.

Under normal conditions, p53 levels are kept low by MDM2. However, in response to cellular stress (DNA damage, hypoxia, oncogene activation), p53 is stabilized and activated. It then orchestrates a response that either repairs the damage or, if the damage is irreparable, eliminates the cell.

## Biological Functions

### 1. Cell Cycle Arrest
p53 induces cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint to allow time for DNA repair.
- **Mechanism:** p53 transcriptionally activates **p21 (CDKN1A)**, which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2), halting the cell cycle.

### 2. DNA Repair
p53 activates the expression of DNA repair genes (e.g., *GADD45*) to fix genetic errors before cell division proceeds.

### 3. Apoptosis (Programmed Cell Death)
If DNA damage is severe and unrepairable, p53 triggers apoptosis to prevent the propagation of mutations.
- **Mechanism:** Upregulates pro-apoptotic proteins like **BAX**, **PUMA**, and **NOXA** while downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins like **BCL-2**.

### 4. Senescence
p53 can induce permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence), preventing the proliferation of damaged cells without killing them.

## Clinical Significance

- **Cancer Mutations:** Somatic mutations in TP53 are found in approximately **50% of all human cancers**, making it the most frequently mutated gene in cancer. Loss of p53 function allows cells with DNA damage to divide, leading to genomic instability and tumor progression.
- **Li-Fraumeni Syndrome:** A rare hereditary disorder caused by germline mutations in TP53. Carriers have a vastly increased risk of developing multiple types of cancer (sarcomas, breast, brain, adrenal) at a young age.
