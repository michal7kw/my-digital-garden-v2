# EGR1

## Overview
The **EGR1** gene (also known as Zif268 or NGFI-A) is an **Immediate Early Gene (IEG)**. This means its transcription is rapidly and transiently activated in response to a wide range of stimuli (growth factors, stress, neurotransmitters) without the need for new protein synthesis.

It is critical for:
1.  **Neuronal Plasticity**: Essential for Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and memory consolidation.
2.  **Cell Growth**: Regulates proliferation and differentiation.
