<h1>EGR1</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>EGR1</strong> gene (also known as Zif268 or NGFI-A) is an <strong>Immediate Early Gene (IEG)</strong>. This means its transcription is rapidly and transiently activated in response to a wide range of stimuli (growth factors, stress, neurotransmitters) without the need for new protein synthesis.</p>
<p>It is critical for:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Neuronal Plasticity</strong>: Essential for Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and memory consolidation.</li>
<li><strong>Cell Growth</strong>: Regulates proliferation and differentiation.</li>
</ol>
