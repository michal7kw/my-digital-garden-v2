# APOE

## Overview

The **APOE** gene encodes **Apolipoprotein E**, a protein essential for the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In the central nervous system, it is the primary cholesterol carrier, produced mainly by astrocytes, and is critical for neuronal repair and maintenance.

Polymorphisms in this gene are the main genetic determinants of Alzheimer's disease risk.

## Alleles and Isoforms

There are three common alleles producing three protein isoforms:

1.  **APOE ε3 (Neutral):** The most common allele (~78% of population). Considered the "wild type" with neutral risk.
2.  **APOE ε4 (Risk):** Present in ~14% of the population.
    *   **Heterozygous (ε3/ε4):** Increases Alzheimer's risk by ~3-fold.
    *   **Homozygous (ε4/ε4):** Increases Alzheimer's risk by ~12-15 fold.
    *   *Mechanism:* Reduces Amyloid-Beta clearance, promotes aggregation, impairs glucose metabolism, and disrupts the blood-brain barrier.
3.  **APOE ε2 (Protective):** Rare (~7%). Associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's but increased risk of Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia.

## Biological Functions

- **Lipid Transport:** Transports cholesterol and phospholipids to neurons via LDL receptor family members.
- **Amyloid Clearance:** Binds to soluble Amyloid-Beta to facilitate its removal from the brain. APOE4 is much less efficient at this than APOE3 or ε2.
- **Inflammation:** Modulates glial activation. APOE4 is associated with a pro-inflammatory state.

## Clinical Significance

- **Alzheimer's Disease:** Strongest genetic risk factor for the late-onset form.
- **Cardiovascular Disease:** APOE4 is associated with higher LDL cholesterol and increased risk of atherosclerosis.
- **Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA):** Impaired clearance leads to amyloid deposition in blood vessel walls.
