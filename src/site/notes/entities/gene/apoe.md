<h1>APOE</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>APOE</strong> gene encodes <strong>Apolipoprotein E</strong>, a protein essential for the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In the central nervous system, it is the primary cholesterol carrier, produced mainly by astrocytes, and is critical for neuronal repair and maintenance.</p>
<p>Polymorphisms in this gene are the main genetic determinants of Alzheimer's disease risk.</p>
<h2>Alleles and Isoforms</h2>
<p>There are three common alleles producing three protein isoforms:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>APOE ε3 (Neutral):</strong> The most common allele (~78% of population). Considered the &quot;wild type&quot; with neutral risk.</li>
<li><strong>APOE ε4 (Risk):</strong> Present in ~14% of the population.
<ul>
<li><strong>Heterozygous (ε3/ε4):</strong> Increases Alzheimer's risk by ~3-fold.</li>
<li><strong>Homozygous (ε4/ε4):</strong> Increases Alzheimer's risk by ~12-15 fold.</li>
<li><em>Mechanism:</em> Reduces Amyloid-Beta clearance, promotes aggregation, impairs glucose metabolism, and disrupts the blood-brain barrier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>APOE ε2 (Protective):</strong> Rare (~7%). Associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's but increased risk of Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Biological Functions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lipid Transport:</strong> Transports cholesterol and phospholipids to neurons via LDL receptor family members.</li>
<li><strong>Amyloid Clearance:</strong> Binds to soluble Amyloid-Beta to facilitate its removal from the brain. APOE4 is much less efficient at this than APOE3 or ε2.</li>
<li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Modulates glial activation. APOE4 is associated with a pro-inflammatory state.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clinical Significance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Disease:</strong> Strongest genetic risk factor for the late-onset form.</li>
<li><strong>Cardiovascular Disease:</strong> APOE4 is associated with higher LDL cholesterol and increased risk of atherosclerosis.</li>
<li><strong>Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA):</strong> Impaired clearance leads to amyloid deposition in blood vessel walls.</li>
</ul>
