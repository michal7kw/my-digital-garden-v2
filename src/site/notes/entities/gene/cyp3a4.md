<h1>CYP3A4</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>CYP3A4</strong> gene encodes the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, which is localized primarily in the liver and small intestine. It is responsible for the metabolism of approximately <strong>50-60% of all prescribed medications</strong>, as well as endogenous substrates like steroids and bile acids.</p>
<p>Genetic polymorphisms in this gene can influence drug efficacy and toxicity, although they are less common/impactful than those of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<ul>
<li>→ [[CYP3A4]] (protein) - <em>Encodes</em></li>
<li>→ [[Liver]] (organ) - <em>Primary expression site</em></li>
<li>→ [[Intestine]] (organ) - <em>Significant expression site</em></li>
</ul>
