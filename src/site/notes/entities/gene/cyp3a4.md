# CYP3A4

## Overview
The **CYP3A4** gene encodes the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, which is localized primarily in the liver and small intestine. It is responsible for the metabolism of approximately **50-60% of all prescribed medications**, as well as endogenous substrates like steroids and bile acids.

Genetic polymorphisms in this gene can influence drug efficacy and toxicity, although they are less common/impactful than those of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19.
