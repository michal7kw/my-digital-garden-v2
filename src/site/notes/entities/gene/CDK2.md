# CDK2

## Overview
The **CDK2** gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that is essential for the G1/S phase transition of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Its activity is regulated by the binding of **Cyclin E** (G1/S) and **Cyclin A** (S/G2).

Dysregulation of CDK2 is observed in various cancers, leading to uncontrolled proliferation.
