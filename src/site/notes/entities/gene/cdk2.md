<h1>CDK2</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>CDK2</strong> gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that is essential for the G1/S phase transition of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Its activity is regulated by the binding of <strong>Cyclin E</strong> (G1/S) and <strong>Cyclin A</strong> (S/G2).</p>
<p>Dysregulation of CDK2 is observed in various cancers, leading to uncontrolled proliferation.</p>
