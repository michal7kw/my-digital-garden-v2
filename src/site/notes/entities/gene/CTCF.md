# CTCF

## Overview
The **CTCF** gene encodes an 11-zinc finger transcription factor that acts as the "master weaver" of the genome. It binds to tens of thousands of sites in the genome to regulate 3D chromatin structure.

Its primary roles are:
1.  **Insulator**: Blocking the interaction between enhancers and promoters.
2.  **Loop Formation**: Creating Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) by anchoring chromatin loops.
