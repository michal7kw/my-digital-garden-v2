# PSEN1

## Overview

The **PSEN1** gene encodes **Presenilin-1**, a multi-pass transmembrane protein that functions as the catalytic core of the **Gamma-Secretase** complex. This protease complex is responsible for the intramembrane cleavage of several proteins, most notably the **Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)** and **Notch** receptors.

Mutations in PSEN1 are the most common cause of **Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD)**, a rare, early-onset form of the disease that is fully penetrant (if you have the mutation, you will develop the disease).

## Biological Functions

### 1. Gamma-Secretase Activity
Presenilin-1 provides the active site (two aspartate residues) for gamma-secretase. This enzyme cleaves APP to generate Amyloid-Beta (Aβ) peptides.
- **Normal Function:** Produces a mix of Aβ40 (shorter, less toxic) and Aβ42 (longer, aggregation-prone).

### 2. Notch Signaling
Cleaves Notch receptors to release the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus to regulate developmental genes. Crucial for neurogenesis and cell differentiation.

### 3. Calcium Homeostasis
Regulates calcium leak from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations can disrupt this, leading to calcium overload and neuronal toxicity.

## Clinical Significance

- **Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD):** Over 200 different mutations in PSEN1 have been identified.
    - **Mechanism:** Most mutations shift the cleavage site, increasing the ratio of **Aβ42 to Aβ40**. Aβ42 aggregates much more rapidly into toxic oligomers and plaques.
    - **Onset:** Typically very early, often between ages 30 and 50.
- **Acne Inversa:** Rare mutations are linked to this chronic skin condition.
