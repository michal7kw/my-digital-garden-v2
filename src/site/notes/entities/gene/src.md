# SRC

## Overview
The **SRC** gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. It was the first **proto-oncogene** ever identified (as the cellular homolog of the v-src gene in Rous Sarcoma Virus).

It plays a pivotal role in regulating cell growth, adhesion, and migration. Mutations or overexpression lead to malignant transformation.
