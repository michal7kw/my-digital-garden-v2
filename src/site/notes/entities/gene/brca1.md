<h1>BRCA1</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>BRCA1</strong> gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in maintaining genomic stability. It acts as a <strong>tumor suppressor</strong>.</p>
<p>Germline mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers.</p>
