# BRCA1

## Overview
The **BRCA1** gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in maintaining genomic stability. It acts as a **tumor suppressor**.

Germline mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers.
