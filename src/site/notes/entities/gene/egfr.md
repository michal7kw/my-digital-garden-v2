# EGFR

## Overview
The **EGFR** gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase of the ErbB family. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, initiating signaling cascades like MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and STAT.

Mutations in this gene are associated with lung cancer (NSCLC) and glioblastoma. Amplification is observed in colorectal cancer and breast cancer.
