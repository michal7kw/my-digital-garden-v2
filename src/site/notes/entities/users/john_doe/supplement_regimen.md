## Supplement Details & Research

### Key Supplements Research

**Vitamin D3**
- **Mechanism**: Fat-soluble vitamin essential for calcium absorption and immune function
- **Evidence Level**: Strong 
- **Current Research**: Studies show optimal range for overall health is 40-60 ng/mL
- **Personalization Factors**: Baseline level of 28 ng/mL indicates need for higher dosing

**Fish Oil**
- **Mechanism**: Provides EPA/DHA omega-3 fatty acids that support cardiovascular health and reduce inflammation
- **Evidence Level**: Strong
- **Current Research**: Minimum effective dose for lipid effects appears to be 2-3g of combined EPA/DHA daily
- **Personalization Factors**: Current lipid panel shows benefit from increased dosage

**Magnesium Glycinate**
- **Mechanism**: Supports over 300 enzymatic reactions, particularly important for muscle relaxation and sleep
- **Evidence Level**: Moderate
- **Current Research**: Glycinate form shows better absorption and fewer GI effects than oxide forms
- **Personalization Factors**: Sleep tracking shows improved deep sleep with consistent use

**[[entities/drug/Creatine\|Creatine]]**
- **Mechanism**: Increases phosphocreatine stores in muscles, rapidly regenerating ATP for high-intensity activities.
- **Evidence Level**: Strong
- **Current Research**: Widely recognized for improving strength, power, and muscle mass in athletic populations.
- **Personalization Factors**: John's regular weight training and desire for performance enhancement.

**[[entities/Supplement/Coenzyme Q10\|Coenzyme Q10]]**
- **Mechanism**: Essential component of the electron transport chain in [[entities/cellularcomponent/Mitochondria\|Mitochondria]], involved in ATP production and acts as a powerful antioxidant.
- **Evidence Level**: Moderate to Strong
- **Current Research**: Research supports its role in cardiovascular health, energy metabolism, and mitigating oxidative stress.
- **Personalization Factors**: John's slightly low CoQ10 levels and interest in mitochondrial health.

## Interactions & Contraindications

### Supplement Interactions
- **Fish Oil + Magnesium**: Complementary for cardiovascular health
- **B-Complex + Magnesium**: Synergistic for energy production and stress response
- **Zinc + Copper**: Monitoring copper intake due to zinc supplementation (obtaining from multivitamin)

### Medication Interactions
- **Ibuprofen + Fish Oil**: Both affect clotting; extra caution when using together
- **No current prescription medications with known supplement interactions**

### Timing Considerations
- Taking Vitamin D and B vitamins in morning due to potential sleep disruption
- Magnesium taken in evening to support relaxation and sleep quality
- Supplements requiring fat absorption (D3, fish oil) taken with meals containing healthy fats

## Supplement Quality Standards

### Brand Preferences
- Looking for GMP-certified manufacturing
- Third-party testing (USP, NSF, or ConsumerLab verification when available)
- Minimal excipients and allergens

### Current Trusted Brands
- Thorne Research (B-Complex, Magnesium)
- Nordic Naturals (Fish Oil)
- Pure Encapsulations (Vitamin D, Zinc)
- Jarrow Formulas (Probiotics)

## Effectiveness Tracking

### Observed Benefits
- Improved sleep initiation with evening magnesium (sleep onset reduced from 35 to 25 minutes)
- Reduced joint discomfort with [[entities/drug/Turmeric\|Turmeric]] supplementation
- Better stress resilience with [[entities/drug/Ashwagandha\|Ashwagandha]] cycles
- Increased strength and endurance during workouts with [[entities/drug/Creatine\|Creatine]]

### Areas for Optimization
- Current fish oil dosage likely insufficient based on latest cholesterol panel
- May benefit from methylated forms of B vitamins due to MTHFR gene variant
- Consider higher potency vitamin D during winter months
- Monitor [[entities/drug/MCT8 Oil\|MCT8 Oil]] intake as part of exploring ketogenic principles
