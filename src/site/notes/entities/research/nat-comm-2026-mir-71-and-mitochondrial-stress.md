# Nat Comm 2026: miR-71 and Mitochondrial Stress

## Overview

Researchers at the University of Queensland identified a specific microRNA, **miR-71**, as a "master switch" for controlling the mitochondrial stress response. Using *C. elegans* models, they demonstrated that miR-71 prevents the dangerous over-activation of stress pathways.

**Paper:** *Published Jan 26, 2026 in Nature Communications*

## Key Findings

1.  **Dampening Signals:** miR-71 binds to specific mRNA targets to inhibit the spread of "stress signals" from damaged mitochondria to the rest of the body.
2.  **Systemic Protection:** Loss of miR-71 led to runaway inflammation and accelerated aging, while its presence ensured a controlled, adaptive response (Hormesis).
3.  **Therapeutic Potential:** Developing miR-71 mimics could treat metabolic disorders driven by chronic mitochondrial stress.
