<h1>Nat Comm 2026: miR-71 and Mitochondrial Stress</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Researchers at the University of Queensland identified a specific microRNA, <strong>miR-71</strong>, as a &quot;master switch&quot; for controlling the mitochondrial stress response. Using <em>C. elegans</em> models, they demonstrated that miR-71 prevents the dangerous over-activation of stress pathways.</p>
<p><strong>Paper:</strong> <em>Published Jan 26, 2026 in Nature Communications</em></p>
<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dampening Signals:</strong> miR-71 binds to specific mRNA targets to inhibit the spread of &quot;stress signals&quot; from damaged mitochondria to the rest of the body.</li>
<li><strong>Systemic Protection:</strong> Loss of miR-71 led to runaway inflammation and accelerated aging, while its presence ensured a controlled, adaptive response (Hormesis).</li>
<li><strong>Therapeutic Potential:</strong> Developing miR-71 mimics could treat metabolic disorders driven by chronic mitochondrial stress.</li>
