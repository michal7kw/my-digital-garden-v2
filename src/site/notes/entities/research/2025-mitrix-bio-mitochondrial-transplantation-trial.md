<h1>2025 Mitrix Bio Mitochondrial Transplantation Trial</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In late 2025, Mitrix Bio initiated informal human trials for <strong>Mitochondrial Transplantation</strong> (Mitotherapy). The concept involves growing young, healthy mitochondria in bioreactors and infusing them into older adults to replenish their bioenergetic capacity.</p>
<h2>Study Design</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participant:</strong> Initial subject was a 90-year-old physicist (John G. Cramer).</li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong> &quot;Mitlets&quot; (mitochondria encapsulated in protective coating) or direct mitochondrial infusion.</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> To treat &quot;Mitochondrial Exhaustion,&quot; a proposed root cause of frailty, cognitive decline, and immune senescence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scientific Context</h2>
<p>Previous animal studies showed that transferring mitochondria from young to old mice could improve energy levels, cognitive function, and muscle endurance. This trial represents the translation of that concept (&quot;Bench to Bedside&quot;).</p>
