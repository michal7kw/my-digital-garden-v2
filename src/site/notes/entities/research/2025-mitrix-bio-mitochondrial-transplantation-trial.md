# 2025 Mitrix Bio Mitochondrial Transplantation Trial

## Overview

In late 2025, Mitrix Bio initiated informal human trials for **Mitochondrial Transplantation** (Mitotherapy). The concept involves growing young, healthy mitochondria in bioreactors and infusing them into older adults to replenish their bioenergetic capacity.

## Study Design

- **Participant:** Initial subject was a 90-year-old physicist (John G. Cramer).
- **Method:** "Mitlets" (mitochondria encapsulated in protective coating) or direct mitochondrial infusion.
- **Goal:** To treat "Mitochondrial Exhaustion," a proposed root cause of frailty, cognitive decline, and immune senescence.

## Scientific Context

Previous animal studies showed that transferring mitochondria from young to old mice could improve energy levels, cognitive function, and muscle endurance. This trial represents the translation of that concept ("Bench to Bedside").
