# 2025 BAM15 Mitochondrial Uncoupling Review

## Overview

Recent studies (2022-2025) have validated **BAM15** as a promising therapeutic for age-related decline. A key 2025 preprint evaluates BAM15 specifically as a drug candidate for sarcopenia. Unlike older uncouplers (like DNP) which were toxic, BAM15 is selective for the mitochondrial inner membrane and does not depolarize the plasma membrane, making it significantly safer.

**Paper:** *Mitochondrial uncoupler BAM15 improves skeletal muscle function and mitochondrial respiration in Sarcopenia*

## Key Findings

1.  **Sarcopenic Obesity:** In older mice, BAM15 prevented fat gain and, surprisingly, **increased muscle mass by 8%** and strength by 40%.
2.  **Mechanism:** It induces a mild proton leak (uncoupling), forcing the mitochondria to burn more fuel (fat/glucose) to maintain the gradient. This mimics the metabolic demand of exercise.
3.  **Inflammation:** Significantly reduced age-related inflammatory markers ("Inflammaging").
4.  **Longevity:** Extended lifespan in mouse models of leukemia and improved healthspan metrics (glucose control, liver health) in diabetic models.
