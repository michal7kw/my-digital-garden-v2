## Abstract
The Q-SYMBIO trial was a landmark multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrating that CoQ10 supplementation (300 mg/day for 2 years) significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure. This study established CoQ10 as the first adjunctive therapy in over a decade to improve survival in heart failure.

## Methodology
```yaml
'{"blinding": "Double-blind (patients, investigators, outcome assessors)", "centers":
  17, "countries": ["Denmark", "Sweden", "Austria", "Slovakia", "Poland", "India",
  "Malaysia", "Australia"], "design": "Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
  trial", "intervention": "CoQ10 100 mg three times daily (300 mg/day) or placebo",
  "randomization": "Centralized computer-generated"}'
```

### Study Design
- **Sample Size**: n=420- **Duration**: 2 years#### Population Characteristics
```yaml
'{"age_mean": "62 years", "exclusion_criteria": ["Acute MI within 3 months", "Unstable
  angina", "Planned cardiac surgery"], "gender": "Both (68% male)", "health_status":
  "Chronic heart failure (NYHA class III-IV)", "inclusion_criteria": ["NYHA class
  III or IV", "LVEF <40%", "Optimal standard therapy"]}'
```

## Results
### Key Findings
```yaml
'{"primary": [{"components": ["Cardiovascular death", "Hospitalization for HF", "Mechanical
  circulatory support", "Heart transplant"], "name": "Major adverse cardiovascular
  events (MACE)", "nnt": 7, "p_value": 0.003, "result": "43% relative risk reduction"}],
  "secondary": [{"name": "All-cause mortality", "p_value": 0.036, "result": "42% reduction"},
  {"name": "Cardiovascular mortality", "p_value": 0.039, "result": "43% reduction"},
  {"name": "NYHA class improvement", "p_value": 0.028, "result": "Significant improvement"},
  {"name": "Hospitalizations for heart failure", "result": "Significantly reduced"}]}'
```

### Statistical Analysis
#### Statistical Significance
```yaml
'{"all_cause_mortality": "HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.96, p = 0.036", "cv_mortality": "HR
  0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.97, p = 0.039", "mace": "HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32-0.80, p = 0.003"}'
```
#### Effect Sizes
```yaml
'{"absolute_risk_reduction": "14%", "mace_reduction": "43% (HR 0.50)", "nnt_for_mace":
  "7 patients over 2 years"}'
```

## Limitations
- Moderate sample size (n=420)
- Primarily European and Australian centers
- High dropout rate (~20%)
- No biomarker-guided treatment
- Older population (mean 62 years)

## Research Integrity
### Funding Sources
- Pharma Nord (provided study drug)
- Heart Research Institute
- Various national heart foundations
### Conflicts of Interest
- Pharma Nord provided study medication and partial funding
- Some investigators received speaking fees from Pharma Nord

## Replication Status
Results consistent with smaller prior studies; no formal replication attempted
