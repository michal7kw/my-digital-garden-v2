## Abstract
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, NMN supplementation (250 mg/day for 10 weeks) increased skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, insulin signaling, and muscle remodeling in postmenopausal prediabetic women. This represents a significant translational study demonstrating NAD+ precursor efficacy in human metabolic dysfunction.

## Keywords
NMN, NAD+, insulin sensitivity, skeletal muscle, aging, prediabetes, metabolic health, SIRT1

## Relationships
STUDIES::[[NMN]] - Primary intervention (250 mg/day oral supplementation)
INCREASES::[[NAD+]] - Target metabolite for biosynthesis elevation
ACTIVATES::[[SIRT1]] - Downstream NAD+-dependent sirtuin activation
AFFECTS::[[Muscle]] - Target tissue (skeletal muscle)
IMPROVES::[[Insulin Resistance]] - Clinical outcome (reduced insulin resistance)
RELATED_TO::[[Diabetes]] - Prediabetic population studied
ACTIVATES::[[AMPK]] - Energy sensing pathway involved
INVOLVES::[[PGC-1alpha]] - Muscle remodeling transcription factor
AFFECTS::[[Mitochondria]] - Metabolic function improvement

## Methodology
```yaml
design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial
randomization: Computer-generated randomization sequence
blinding: Double-blind (participants and investigators)
intervention: 250 mg/day NMN or placebo for 10 weeks
```

### Study Design
- **Sample Size**: n=25
- **Duration**: 10 weeks
#### Population Characteristics
```yaml
age_range: 55-75 years
gender: Female (postmenopausal)
health_status: Prediabetic, overweight or obese
inclusion_criteria:
  - BMI 25-40 kg/m2
  - Prediabetic (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%)
  - Postmenopausal
```

## Results
### Key Findings
```yaml
primary:
  - name: Muscle insulin sensitivity
    measure: Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
    result: 25% improvement in glucose disposal rate
    p_value: 0.007
secondary:
  - name: Muscle NAD+ content
    result: Increased but not statistically significant
  - name: Insulin signaling (AKT phosphorylation)
    result: Significantly increased
  - name: Muscle remodeling gene expression
    result: Upregulated
```

### Statistical Analysis
#### Statistical Significance
```yaml
primary_outcome: p = 0.007 for glucose disposal rate
adjustment: None required (single primary outcome)
```
#### Effect Sizes
```yaml
glucose_disposal: 25% improvement (NMN vs placebo)
confidence_interval: 95% CI: 8-42%
```

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=25)
- Female-only cohort limits generalizability
- Short duration (10 weeks)
- Single dose tested (250 mg/day)
- No long-term follow-up

## Research Integrity
### Funding Sources
- National Institutes of Health (NIH)
- Nutrition Obesity Research Center (Washington University)
### Conflicts of Interest
- S.I. Imai is co-inventor of patents related to NMN
