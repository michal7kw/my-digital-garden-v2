# Mitophagy

## Overview

Mitophagy is a specialized form of autophagy that selectively degrades damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria. This process is essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality and cellular homeostasis.

## Mechanism

Mitophagy can be triggered through:
- **PINK1/Parkin pathway**: Primary mechanism for damaged mitochondria recognition
- **Receptor-mediated pathways**: BNIP3, NIX, FUNDC1
- **Lipid-mediated pathways**: Cardiolipin externalization

## Role in Disease

Defective mitophagy is implicated in:
- Parkinson's disease
- Alzheimer's disease
- Cardiovascular disease
- Aging and senescence

## Nicotine Effects

According to PMID:31197632, nicotine influences mitophagy as part of its broader effects on mitochondrial function, though specific mechanisms require further investigation.
