# Alpha-Synuclein Aggregation

## Overview
Alpha-synuclein aggregation is the central pathological process underlying Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. The normally soluble 140-amino acid protein misfolds and self-assembles into toxic oligomers and insoluble fibrils, which accumulate in neurons as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. This process leads to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death.

## Normal Alpha-Synuclein Function
- Concentrated at presynaptic terminals
- Regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking
- Modulates dopamine release
- Interacts with lipid membranes
- May function as a chaperone

## Aggregation Cascade

### 1. Monomeric State
- Native, unfolded protein
- Membrane-bound: alpha-helical
- Cytoplasmic: intrinsically disordered

### 2. Oligomer Formation
- Misfolded monomers associate
- **Most toxic species**
- Membrane permeabilization
- Mitochondrial dysfunction

### 3. Protofibril Stage
- Ordered beta-sheet structures
- Intermediate aggregates
- Seeding capability

### 4. Mature Fibrils
- Insoluble amyloid structures
- Cross-beta sheet architecture
- May be less acutely toxic than oligomers

### 5. Lewy Bodies
- Dense cytoplasmic inclusions
- Surrounded by organelles and cytoskeletal elements
- Diagnostic hallmark of PD

## Triggers and Risk Factors

### Genetic
- **SNCA gene**: Duplications, triplications, point mutations
- **GBA1 mutations**: Impaired lysosomal function
- **LRRK2 mutations**: Phosphorylation abnormalities

### Environmental
- Pesticides (rotenone, paraquat)
- Heavy metals
- Oxidative stress

### Cellular Stress
- Mitochondrial dysfunction
- Proteasome impairment
- ER stress
- Aging

## Prion-Like Spreading

### Cell-to-Cell Transmission
1. Misfolded alpha-synuclein released from neurons
2. Uptake by neighboring cells
3. Templated seeding of native protein
4. Spreading along neuronal networks

### Braak Staging
- Pathology starts in olfactory bulb and enteric nervous system
- Spreads to brainstem (Stage 1-2)
- Reaches substantia nigra (Stage 3)
- Progresses to cortex (Stage 4-6)

## Therapeutic Targets

### Aggregation Inhibition
- Small molecule aggregation inhibitors
- Molecular chaperones
- Heat shock proteins

### Clearance Enhancement
- Autophagy activation
- Lysosomal function restoration
- Ubiquitin-proteasome enhancement

### Immunotherapy
- Active vaccines (affitope)
- Passive immunization (anti-α-syn antibodies)
- Prasinezumab, cinpanemab in trials

### Gene Therapy
- Antisense oligonucleotides
- siRNA approaches
- SNCA reduction strategies
