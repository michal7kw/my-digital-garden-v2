# Autophagy

## Overview

**Autophagy** (from Greek "self-eating") is a fundamental cellular survival mechanism. It involves the sequestration of damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and pathogens into double-membrane vesicles called **autophagosomes**, which then fuse with **lysosomes** for degradation and recycling.

It is the primary mechanism for maintaining **proteostasis** (protein quality control) and organelle quality (e.g., removing damaged mitochondria). Dysfunctional autophagy is a hallmark of aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Mechanism and Regulation

### Key Regulators
Autophagy is tightly controlled by nutrient-sensing pathways:
1.  **mTOR (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin):** The master *inhibitor* of autophagy. When nutrients (especially amino acids) and insulin are high, mTOR suppresses autophagy to promote growth.
2.  **AMPK (AMP-activated Protein Kinase):** The master *activator*. Activated by low energy states (high AMP/ATP ratio), it inhibits mTOR and directly phosphorylates autophagy-initiation proteins (like ULK1).

### The Process
1.  **Initiation:** Triggered by stress/starvation.
2.  **Nucleation:** Formation of the phagophore.
3.  **Elongation:** Expansion of the membrane to engulf cargo.
4.  **Fusion:** Autophagosome fuses with a lysosome.
5.  **Degradation:** Acidic hydrolases break down the cargo into basic building blocks (amino acids, fatty acids) for reuse.

## Clinical Significance

- **Longevity:** Enhanced autophagy is required for the lifespan-extending effects of caloric restriction.
- **Neurodegeneration:** Failure to clear aggregated proteins (like Amyloid Beta, Tau, Alpha-Synuclein) drives Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
- **Cancer:** Dual role; suppresses tumor initiation by maintaining genomic stability, but promotes survival of established tumors under stress.
- **Immunity:** Eliminates intracellular pathogens (xenophagy).
