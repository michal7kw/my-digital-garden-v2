# Electron Transport Chain

## Overview

The electron transport chain (ETC) is the metabolic pathway in the inner mitochondrial membrane responsible for oxidative phosphorylation. It consists of four major protein complexes (I-IV) plus ATP synthase (Complex V).

## Components

- **Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase)**: Entry point for NADH electrons
- **Complex II (Succinate dehydrogenase)**: Entry point for FADH2 electrons
- **Complex III (Cytochrome bc1)**: Electron transfer to cytochrome c
- **Complex IV (Cytochrome c oxidase)**: Final electron transfer to oxygen
- **ATP Synthase (Complex V)**: Uses proton gradient for ATP production

## Function

1. Electrons flow through the chain from NADH/FADH2 to oxygen
2. Protons are pumped across the inner membrane
3. Proton gradient drives ATP synthesis
4. Produces ~90% of cellular ATP

## Nicotine Effects

According to PMID:31197632, nicotine affects the respiratory chain as part of its broad effects on mitochondrial function, potentially impacting energy production and ROS generation.
