# Neuroinflammation

## Overview
Neuroinflammation refers to the inflammatory response within the central nervous system (CNS), mediated primarily by resident immune cells—microglia and astrocytes. While acute neuroinflammation is protective (clearing pathogens and debris), chronic or dysregulated inflammation becomes detrimental, contributing to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and disease progression in virtually all neurodegenerative conditions.

## Key Cellular Players

### Microglia
- CNS-resident macrophages
- First responders to injury/pathology
- Highly dynamic surveillants
- Can be pro-inflammatory (M1-like) or anti-inflammatory (M2-like)

### Astrocytes
- Reactive astrogliosis in disease
- A1 (neurotoxic) vs A2 (neuroprotective) phenotypes
- Barrier function compromised
- Contribute to scar formation

### Peripheral Immune Cells
- T cells, monocytes can infiltrate CNS
- Blood-brain barrier breakdown allows entry
- Both protective and damaging roles

## Inflammatory Mediators

### Pro-Inflammatory
| Mediator | Source | Effect |
|----------|--------|--------|
| TNF-α | Microglia | Neuronal death, BBB disruption |
| IL-1β | Microglia, astrocytes | Fever, sickness behavior |
| IL-6 | Multiple | Acute phase response |
| CCL2 | Astrocytes | Monocyte recruitment |
| NO/iNOS | Microglia | Oxidative damage |
| Complement (C1q, C3) | Microglia | Synaptic pruning |

### Anti-Inflammatory
| Mediator | Source | Effect |
|----------|--------|--------|
| IL-10 | Microglia | Suppresses inflammation |
| TGF-β | Astrocytes, microglia | Resolution, repair |
| IL-4, IL-13 | T cells | M2 polarization |
| Resolvins, protectins | Multiple | Resolution of inflammation |

## Disease-Specific Patterns

### Alzheimer's Disease
- Microglia cluster around plaques
- TREM2 variants increase AD risk
- Complement-mediated synapse loss
- Chronic activation drives progression

### Parkinson's Disease
- Microglial activation in substantia nigra
- α-synuclein triggers inflammation
- T cell infiltration
- Peripheral inflammation contributes

### Multiple Sclerosis
- Autoimmune attack on myelin
- T cell-mediated demyelination
- Microglial/macrophage phagocytosis
- Both detrimental and remyelination support

### ALS
- Microglial activation along motor pathways
- Astrocyte glutamate dysregulation
- Complement activation
- Contributes to motor neuron death

## Inflammaging

### Age-Related Changes
- Increased basal inflammation with aging
- Microglial priming (hyper-responsive)
- Reduced resolution mechanisms
- Senescence-associated phenotype

### Systemic-CNS Crosstalk
- Peripheral inflammation affects brain
- Gut-brain axis involvement
- Metabolic inflammation (obesity, diabetes)

## Biomarkers

### CSF Markers
- sTREM2 (soluble TREM2)
- YKL-40/chitinase-3-like-1
- Neopterin
- Complement proteins

### Blood Markers
- CRP, IL-6, TNF-α
- Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
- Cytokine panels

### Imaging
- TSPO PET (microglial activation)
- [11C]PK11195, [18F]DPA-714
