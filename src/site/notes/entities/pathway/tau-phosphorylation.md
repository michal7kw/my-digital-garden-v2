# Tau Phosphorylation

## Overview
Tau phosphorylation is a normal regulatory mechanism that modulates tau's microtubule-binding affinity. However, in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated at numerous sites, causing it to detach from microtubules, misfold, and aggregate into paired helical filaments (PHFs) that form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). This process disrupts axonal transport, causes synaptic dysfunction, and leads to neuronal death.

## Normal Tau Function

### Microtubule Stabilization
- Six isoforms from alternative splicing
- Binds and stabilizes microtubules
- Essential for axonal transport
- Phosphorylation regulates binding affinity

### Normal Phosphorylation
- ~80 potential phosphorylation sites
- 2-3 moles phosphate per mole tau normally
- Regulates microtubule dynamics
- Cell cycle-dependent variation

## Pathological Hyperphosphorylation

### Key Phosphorylation Sites
| Site | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| Thr181 (p-tau181) | Diagnostic biomarker |
| Thr217 (p-tau217) | Most specific for AD |
| Thr231 (p-tau231) | Early marker |
| Ser202/Thr205 (AT8) | Classic tangle epitope |
| Ser396/Ser404 (PHF-1) | Late tangle marker |

### Hyperphosphorylated Tau
- 3-4x more phosphate than normal
- Reduced microtubule affinity
- Increased aggregation propensity
- Gain of toxic function

## Kinases and Phosphatases

### Tau Kinases (Increase Phosphorylation)
- **GSK-3β**: Primary tau kinase; drug target
- **CDK5/p25**: Activated by calpain cleavage
- **MARK kinases**: Affect microtubule binding
- **DYRK1A**: Overactive in Down syndrome
- **CK1**: Multiple sites phosphorylated

### Tau Phosphatases (Decrease Phosphorylation)
- **PP2A**: Main tau phosphatase; reduced in AD
- **PP1**: Secondary role
- **Calcineurin**: Calcium-dependent

### Imbalance in Disease
- Increased kinase activity
- Decreased phosphatase activity
- Net hyperphosphorylation

## Aggregation Cascade

### 1. Hyperphosphorylation
- Tau detaches from microtubules
- Accumulates in cytoplasm
- Conformational changes

### 2. Oligomer Formation
- Tau self-associates
- Toxic oligomeric species
- Synaptic dysfunction

### 3. Paired Helical Filaments (PHFs)
- Beta-sheet rich structures
- Building blocks of tangles
- Cross-beta architecture

### 4. Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs)
- Dense intracellular aggregates
- Displace organelles
- Correlate with dementia severity

## Spreading and Staging

### Braak Staging (AD)
- **Stage I-II**: Transentorhinal cortex
- **Stage III-IV**: Limbic (hippocampus, amygdala)
- **Stage V-VI**: Neocortex (widespread)

### Prion-Like Propagation
- Pathological tau seeds normal tau
- Template-directed misfolding
- Spreads along neural networks
