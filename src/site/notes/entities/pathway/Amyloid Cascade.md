# Amyloid Cascade

## Overview
The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis, proposed by Hardy and Higgins in 1992, posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides is the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. According to this model, Aβ deposition triggers a cascade of events including tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and ultimately neuronal death. While central to AD research, the hypothesis has evolved and been debated.

## Amyloid-Beta Production

                        ↓
                  Aβ40 or Aβ42
```

### Key Peptides
- **Aβ40**: Most abundant (90%); less aggregation-prone
- **Aβ42**: Minor (10%); highly aggregation-prone; most toxic
- Aβ42/40 ratio indicates pathology

## Cascade Steps

### 1. Aβ Accumulation
- Overproduction (genetic mutations)
- Decreased clearance (APOE4, aging)
- Imbalanced Aβ42/40 ratio

### 2. Oligomerization
- Soluble Aβ oligomers form
- **Most toxic species**
- Synaptic dysfunction
- LTP inhibition

### 3. Plaque Formation
- Oligomers → protofibrils → fibrils
- Extracellular amyloid plaques
- Neuritic plaques with dystrophic neurites

### 4. Microglial Activation
- Plaques trigger neuroinflammation
- Pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Chronic inflammation

### 5. Tau Pathology
- Aβ triggers tau hyperphosphorylation
- Neurofibrillary tangles form
- Axonal transport disruption

### 6. Synaptic Failure
- Synapse loss correlates with dementia
- Cholinergic deficit
- Glutamate dysregulation

### 7. Neuronal Death
- Apoptosis and necrosis
- Brain atrophy
- Clinical dementia

## Evidence Supporting

### Genetic
- APP mutations cause familial AD
- PSEN1/PSEN2 mutations increase Aβ42
- Down syndrome (3 copies APP) → early AD
- APOE4 reduces Aβ clearance

### Biomarker
- CSF Aβ42 decreases before symptoms
- Amyloid PET positive years before dementia
- Anti-amyloid drugs reduce plaques

### Recent Validation
- Lecanemab and donanemab show clinical efficacy
- Slowing of cognitive decline when plaques cleared

## Evidence Challenging

### Timing Issues
- Plaques precede symptoms by decades
- Tau pathology correlates better with symptoms
- Cognitively normal individuals with plaques exist

### Failed Therapies (Historical)
- Many anti-amyloid drugs failed (solanezumab, aducanumab controversy)
- Plaque removal without clinical benefit in some trials

### Modified Hypotheses
- Oligomer-centric (not plaques)
- Upstream triggers (inflammation, metabolism)
- Aβ as downstream consequence
- Network-centric models

## Therapeutic Strategies

### Production Inhibition
- BACE1 inhibitors (discontinued due to toxicity)
- γ-secretase modulators

### Clearance Enhancement
- Anti-Aβ immunotherapy (successful)
- APOE-targeted approaches
- Proteolytic degradation enhancement

### Aggregation Prevention
- Small molecule aggregation inhibitors
- Oligomer-selective antibodies

### Combination Approaches
- Anti-amyloid + anti-tau
- Disease-modifying + symptomatic

## Current Status (2025)

### FDA-Approved Therapies
- **Lecanemab (Leqembi)**: Protofibrils; ~27% slowing
- **Donanemab (Kisunla)**: N-terminal Aβ; ~35% slowing

### Implications
- Validates amyloid as therapeutic target
- Earlier intervention likely more effective
- Combination with tau therapies anticipated
