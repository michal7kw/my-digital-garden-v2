# Amyloid PET Imaging

## Overview
Amyloid PET imaging is a nuclear medicine technique that visualizes amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque deposition in the living brain. Using radiotracers that specifically bind to fibrillar Aβ, it provides direct evidence of Alzheimer's pathology years before clinical symptoms. It is now essential for determining eligibility for FDA-approved anti-amyloid therapies (lecanemab, donanemab).

## FDA-Approved Radiotracers

| Tracer | Brand Name | Half-life | FDA Approval |
|--------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| [18F]Florbetapir | Amyvid | 110 min | 2012 |
| [18F]Florbetaben | Neuraceq | 110 min | 2014 |
| [18F]Flutemetamol | Vizamyl | 110 min | 2013 |
| [11C]PiB | Pittsburgh Compound B | 20 min | Research only |

### Tracer Characteristics
- **18F tracers**: Longer half-life allows distribution from cyclotron
- **11C-PiB**: Original research tracer; requires on-site cyclotron
- All bind fibrillar Aβ with high affinity
- Cannot distinguish Aβ40 from Aβ42

## Clinical Indications

### Appropriate Use (AUC 2013, Updated 2022)
1. **Unexplained MCI** with atypical features
2. **Atypical dementia presentations** (young onset, non-amnestic)
3. **Progressive, unexplained cognitive decline**
4. **Anti-amyloid therapy eligibility** (lecanemab, donanemab)

### Inappropriate Use
- Typical AD with classic presentation (clinical diagnosis sufficient)
- Asymptomatic individuals (outside research)
- Non-progressive complaints
- Severity staging of known AD

## Interpretation

### Visual Assessment
- **Positive**: Loss of gray-white differentiation; diffuse cortical uptake
- **Negative**: Preserved gray-white contrast; white matter only
- Binary read (positive/negative) by trained readers

### Quantitative Analysis (Research/Trials)
- **SUVR** (Standardized Uptake Value Ratio)
- **Centiloid scale**: Standardized across tracers (0-100+)
  - 0 = young healthy control
  - 100 = typical AD patient
  - Threshold ~20-25 CL for positivity

## Relationship to Disease Stage

| Stage | Amyloid PET | Clinical Status |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Preclinical AD | Positive | Cognitively normal |
| Prodromal AD (MCI) | Positive | Mild impairment |
| AD Dementia | Positive | Dementia |
| Non-AD dementia | Usually negative | Other pathology |

### Timeline
- Amyloid accumulation begins **15-20 years** before symptoms
- PET becomes positive ~10-15 years before clinical AD
- Plateaus in symptomatic disease

## Anti-Amyloid Therapy Eligibility

### Requirements (Lecanemab, Donanemab)
1. **Confirmed amyloid positivity** (PET or CSF)
2. Early symptomatic AD (MCI or mild dementia)
3. No contraindications (anticoagulation, prior hemorrhage)

### Monitoring During Treatment
- Baseline PET required
- Some trials show amyloid clearance
- Repeat PET to confirm plaque reduction

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- Gold standard for amyloid detection in vivo
- High sensitivity and specificity (~95%)
- Direct visualization of pathology
- Essential for treatment eligibility

### Limitations
- **Cost**: $3,000-6,000 per scan
- **Radiation exposure**: ~7 mSv
- **Availability**: Limited to specialized centers
- **Off-target binding**: White matter, age-related
- **Cannot detect soluble oligomers**: Only fibrillar Aβ

## Comparison: Amyloid PET vs CSF Aβ42/40

| Feature | Amyloid PET | CSF Aβ42/40 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Invasiveness | Non-invasive | Lumbar puncture |
| Cost | High (~$5,000) | Moderate (~$500) |
| Availability | Limited | More available |
| Concordance | ~90% agreement | Reference standard |
| Spatial info | Regional distribution | Global marker |
| Radiation | Yes (~7 mSv) | None |

## Emerging Developments

### Plasma-Based Screening
- Blood Aβ42/40 may pre-screen for PET
- Reduce unnecessary scans
- Two-step algorithm proposed

### Second-Generation Tracers
- Improved signal-to-noise
- Lower off-target binding
- Potential for earlier detection
