# Tau PET Imaging

## Overview
Tau PET imaging visualizes tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the living brain using radiotracers selective for aggregated tau protein. Unlike amyloid PET, tau PET signal correlates strongly with cognitive symptoms, neurodegeneration, and clinical disease stage. Tau pathology spreads in a predictable pattern (Braak staging), and tau PET can track this progression.

## FDA-Approved and Research Tracers

| Tracer | Status | Selectivity | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| [18F]Flortaucipir (Tauvid) | FDA approved (2020) | 3R/4R tau (AD) | Some off-target binding |
| [18F]PI-2620 | Research | 3R/4R and 4R tau | Better for non-AD tauopathies |
| [18F]MK-6240 | Research/trials | 3R/4R tau | Lower off-target binding |
| [18F]RO-948 | Research | 3R/4R tau | Minimal off-target |
| [18F]GTP1 | Research | 3R/4R tau | Genentech tracer |

### Tau Isoforms
- **3R/4R tau**: Alzheimer's disease, CTE
- **4R tau**: PSP, CBD
- **3R tau**: Pick's disease
- First-gen tracers (flortaucipir) bind 3R/4R best

## Clinical Indications

### FDA-Approved Use (Flortaucipir)
- Estimating density and distribution of tau NFTs in adults with cognitive impairment being evaluated for AD

### Research Applications
- Staging of tau pathology
- Clinical trial patient selection
- Monitoring anti-tau therapies
- Differentiating tauopathies

## Braak Staging on Tau PET

| Braak Stage | Region | Clinical Correlation |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| I-II | Transentorhinal | Preclinical/early MCI |
| III-IV | Limbic (hippocampus, amygdala) | MCI/early dementia |
| V-VI | Neocortical (widespread) | Moderate-severe dementia |

### Progression Pattern
- Entorhinal → Hippocampus → Temporal → Parietal → Frontal
- Correlates with symptom domain affected
- More dynamic than amyloid (changes over 1-2 years)

## Interpretation

### Quantitative Measures
- **SUVR**: Standardized uptake value ratio
- Reference region: Inferior cerebellar gray
- Threshold varies by region and tracer

### Visual Assessment
- Braak-like staging
- Regional distribution pattern
- Asymmetry in atypical variants

## Clinical-Pathological Correlations

### Superior to Amyloid PET for:
- Predicting cognitive decline
- Correlating with symptom severity
- Tracking disease progression
- Predicting brain atrophy

### Typical AD Pattern
- Posterior cingulate/precuneus early
- Lateral temporal spread
- Parietal involvement
- Frontal sparing until late

### Atypical AD Variants
| Variant | Tau PET Pattern |
|---------|-----------------|
| Posterior Cortical Atrophy | Occipitoparietal predominant |
| Logopenic PPA | Left temporoparietal |
| Behavioral/Dysexecutive | Frontal involvement |

## Off-Target Binding Considerations

### First-Generation (Flortaucipir)
- **Choroid plexus**: Limiting for medial temporal assessment
- **Basal ganglia**: Melanin/neuromelanin binding
- **Hemorrhage/iron**: Non-specific binding
- **MAO enzymes**: Some off-target signal

### Second-Generation Improvements
- Reduced off-target binding
- Better signal in medial temporal lobe
- Improved non-AD tauopathy detection
