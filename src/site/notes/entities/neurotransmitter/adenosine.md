# Adenosine

## Overview

**Adenosine** is a neuromodulator that functions as the brain's "fatigue signal." It is a byproduct of ATP breakdown: as neurons work and consume energy (ATP → ADP → AMP), adenosine accumulates in the extracellular space.

This accumulation creates **Sleep Pressure** (homeostatic sleep drive). When we sleep, adenosine is cleared or re-phosphorylated back to ATP, resetting the pressure.

## Mechanism

- **Receptors:** Binds primarily to **A1 receptors** (inhibitory) on wake-promoting neurons, slowing down nerve activity.
- **Caffeine:** Structurally similar to adenosine. It acts as a **competitive antagonist**, blocking adenosine from binding to its receptors without activating them. This masks the feeling of fatigue but does not remove the sleep need.

## Recent Research (2025)

A breakthrough 2025 study linked adenosine accumulation directly to **mitochondrial electrical stress** (electron leak) in sleep-regulating neurons, unifying the theories of energy metabolism and sleep function.
