# Glucose

## Overview
Tested twice a year Glucose is the body’s main source of energy, fueling cells throughout the day. Testing glucose levels can reveal early signs of imbalances like prediabetes or diabetes, allowing action to be taken sooner. High levels may mean the body isn't using insulin effectively, which over time can affect the heart, nerves, and kidneys. Low levels can also cause issues if not addressed, making glucose an important marker for overall metabolic health.
