description: Tested twice a year Squamous epithelial cells in urine usually come from
  the lower urinary tract or genital area and are often a sign of sample contamination
  rather than disease. However, when present in higher numbers alongside other abnormalities,
  they can point to chronic inflammation, infection, or other conditions of the urinary
  tract.
