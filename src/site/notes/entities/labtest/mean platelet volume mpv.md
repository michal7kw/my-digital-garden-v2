# mean_platelet_volume_mpv

## Overview
Tested twice a year Mean platelet volume (MPV) measures the average size of platelets, the cells that help blood clot and stop bleeding. High MPV means the body is making larger, younger platelets, often in response to blood loss, inflammation, or certain bone marrow or blood disorders. Low MPV can signal slower platelet production or conditions such as chronic inflammation or bone marrow disease. Because platelet size reflects how well the body is forming clots, MPV can help explain symptoms like easy bruising or unusual bleeding..
