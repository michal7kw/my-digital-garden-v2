# amylase

## Overview
Amylase is a digestive enzyme made by the salivary glands and pancreas that helps break down complex carbohydrates from food into usable energy. Abnormal levels can be an early sign of problems in the salivary glands, strain on the digestive system due to celiac disease or IBD, and pancreatic stress.
