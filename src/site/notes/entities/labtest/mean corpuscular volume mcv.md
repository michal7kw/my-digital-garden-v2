# mean_corpuscular_volume_mcv

## Overview
Tested twice a year Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) looks at the average size of red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen throughout the body. Smaller-than-normal cells (low MCV) are often linked to iron deficiency anemia or thalassemia, while larger cells (high MCV) can suggest vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, liver disease, or other conditions. Because cell size gives important clues about oxygen delivery, MCV is a key marker for uncovering the cause of anemia and symptoms like tiredness or weakness.
