# Vitamin D

## Overview
Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for immune health, strong bones and muscles, and optimal brain performance. Unlike most vitamins, it isn't widely available in food and is mainly made in the body through sun exposure. Because of this, low levels are common, and maintaining healthy vitamin D is important to support energy, mood, and long-term immune, bone, and cardiovascular health.
