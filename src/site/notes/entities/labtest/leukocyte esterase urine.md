# leukocyte_esterase_urine

## Overview
Leukocyte esterase in urine is an enzyme released by white blood cells (WBCs), and its presence in urine often signals the body is responding to infection or inflammation in the urinary tract. A positive result suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) or another inflammatory process in the urinary tract.
