# thyroxine_t4_free

## Overview
Thyroxine (T4) Freeis one of the main hormones made by the thyroid. It acts largely as a precursor, since most of it is later converted into T3, the more active form. Measuring free T4 shows how much thyroid hormone is being produced and available for conversion, providing valuable insight into thyroid function.
