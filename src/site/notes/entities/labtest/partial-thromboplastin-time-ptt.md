# Partial Thromboplastin Time PTT

## Overview
The Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT, commonly abbreviated as PTT) is a coagulation screening test that measures the time required for plasma to clot after the addition of a contact activator (kaolin, ellagic acid, or silica), phospholipid, and calcium. It evaluates the intrinsic coagulation pathway (Factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII) and the common pathway (Factors X, V, II/prothrombin, and I/fibrinogen).

The primary clinical applications of aPTT are monitoring unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy, screening for inherited or acquired coagulation factor deficiencies, and detecting lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies. For heparin monitoring, the therapeutic aPTT range is typically 1.5-2.5 times the normal control value, although each institution calibrates its specific aPTT reagent to correspond with therapeutic anti-Xa heparin levels (0.3-0.7 IU/mL).

An isolated prolonged aPTT (with normal PT) suggests deficiency of factors unique to the intrinsic pathway: XII, XI, IX (hemophilia B), VIII (hemophilia A), prekallikrein, or high-molecular-weight kininogen. If both PT and aPTT are prolonged, common pathway factors (X, V, II, I) or multiple factor deficiencies should be suspected. A mixing study (1:1 mix with normal plasma) can distinguish factor deficiency (corrects with mixing) from an inhibitor such as lupus anticoagulant (does not correct).

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Coagulation |
| **Test Type** | Standard |
| **Sample Type** | Blood |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |

| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal** | 25-35 seconds | Normal intrinsic pathway function |
| **Therapeutic (on heparin)** | 60-80 seconds (1.5-2.5x control) | Target for UFH anticoagulation |
| **Prolonged** | >35 seconds (without heparin) | Factor deficiency or inhibitor present |
| **Critical** | >100 seconds | High bleeding risk; urgent evaluation |

## Recommended For

### Included In
- → [[coagulation panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory and reagent system
- aPTT is sensitive to heparin contamination; ensure sample is collected from non-heparinized line
- Mixing studies differentiate factor deficiencies (correct) from inhibitors (do not correct)
- Lupus anticoagulant paradoxically prolongs aPTT in vitro but causes thrombosis in vivo
- Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) does NOT reliably prolong aPTT; use anti-Xa levels instead
- Factor XII deficiency prolongs aPTT but does NOT cause clinical bleeding
