# Bilirubin, Urine

## Overview
Tested twice a year Bilirubin is a natural substance produced when the body breaks down old red blood cells. Under healthy conditions, the liver processes bilirubin, and it is not usually present in urine. When bilirubin does appear in urine, it may indicate that the liver or bile ducts are not processing it normally.
