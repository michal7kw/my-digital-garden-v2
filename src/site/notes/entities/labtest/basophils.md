# Basophils

## Overview
Tested twice a year Basophils account for around <1% of white blood cells that help defend the body, which support immune responses against parasites and shape allergic reactions. When their activity is increased, basophils can be associated with conditions such as asthma, eczema, and autoimmune diseases. The test includes both percentage and absolute levels.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
