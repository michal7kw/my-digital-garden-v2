# Prothrombin Time PT/INR

## Overview
The Prothrombin Time (PT) is a coagulation test that measures the time (in seconds) for plasma to clot after the addition of tissue thromboplastin (tissue factor) and calcium. It evaluates the extrinsic coagulation pathway (Factor VII) and the common pathway (Factors X, V, II/prothrombin, and I/fibrinogen). The International Normalized Ratio (INR) is a standardized calculation derived from the PT that accounts for differences between thromboplastin reagents used by different laboratories.

The INR is the most critical laboratory test for monitoring oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin/coumarin). The therapeutic INR range for most indications (atrial fibrillation, DVT/PE treatment, mechanical aortic valve) is 2.0-3.0. For mechanical mitral valves and recurrent thromboembolism, a higher target of 2.5-3.5 is recommended. INR values below the therapeutic range indicate insufficient anticoagulation (thrombotic risk), while values above indicate excessive anticoagulation (bleeding risk).

PT/INR is also valuable for assessing liver synthetic function, as the liver produces most coagulation factors. In acute and chronic liver disease, a prolonged PT/elevated INR indicates impaired hepatic protein synthesis and is a component of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score used for liver transplant prioritization.

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Coagulation |
| **Test Type** | Standard |
| **Sample Type** | Blood |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal PT** | 11-13.5 seconds | Normal coagulation function |
| **Normal INR (not on warfarin)** | 0.8-1.1 | Normal coagulation |
| **Therapeutic INR (warfarin)** | 2.0-3.0 | Target for most indications |
| **High-intensity INR** | 2.5-3.5 | Target for mechanical mitral valve |
| **Supratherapeutic INR** | >4.0 | Increased bleeding risk; dose adjustment needed |
| **Critical INR** | >5.0 | Significant bleeding risk; urgent intervention |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Warfarin Therapy Monitoring]]
- [[Liver Disease]]
- [[Coagulopathy]]
- [[Vitamin K Deficiency]]
- [[DIC]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Prothrombin Time]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[coagulation panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- INR should be used instead of PT seconds for warfarin monitoring (standardized across labs)
- Vitamin K-rich foods (leafy greens) can decrease INR in warfarin patients
- Many drugs interact with warfarin and affect INR (antibiotics, NSAIDs, antifungals)
- PT/INR is included in the MELD score for liver disease severity assessment
- Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine INR monitoring
