# Nitrite, Urine

## Overview
Tested twice a year Nitrites in urine can form when bacteria in the urinary tract convert naturally occurring nitrates into nitrites. Because nitrites in urine are not normally present in healthy individuals, their presence can serve as a marker that bacteria are present somewhere along the urinary tract, making it a useful marker for urinary tract infections.
