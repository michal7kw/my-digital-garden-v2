description: Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) test measures LDL cholesterol particles that have
  been modified by oxidation. Oxidized LDL is a key driver of atherosclerosis, promoting
  foam cell formation, endothelial dysfunction, and plaque instability. More specific
  for cardiovascular risk than standard LDL cholesterol.

# Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL)

## Overview
The oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) test measures LDL cholesterol particles that have undergone oxidative modification. While native LDL is taken up by cells through regulated LDL receptors, oxidized LDL is recognized by scavenger receptors on macrophages in an unregulated manner, leading to cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation - the hallmark of early atherosclerosis.

Ox-LDL measurement provides a more specific assessment of atherogenic risk compared to standard LDL cholesterol. Two individuals with identical LDL levels may have very different cardiovascular risk profiles depending on the proportion of their LDL that is oxidized. Ox-LDL also directly promotes endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and smooth muscle cell proliferation in vessel walls.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Cardiovascular |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood (plasma) |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | Yes (12-hour) |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | No |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Low Risk** | <60 U/L | Low atherogenic risk |
| **Borderline** | 60-70 U/L | Moderate oxidative modification |
| **High Risk** | >70 U/L | Significant LDL oxidation; increased CVD risk |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Cardiovascular Disease]]
- [[Atherosclerosis]]
- [[Metabolic Syndrome]]
- [[Type 2 Diabetes]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Oxidized LDL]] (biomarker)

### Related Tests
- → [[ldl cholesterol]] (labtest) - Standard LDL measurement
- → [[ldl particle number]] (labtest) - Particle count assessment
- → [[ldl small]] (labtest) - Small dense LDL (more susceptible to oxidation)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted alongside standard lipid panel
- Small dense LDL particles are more susceptible to oxidation than large buoyant LDL
- Antioxidant status affects ox-LDL levels
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory and assay method
