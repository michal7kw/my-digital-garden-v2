# LDH

## Overview
Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) is a cytoplasmic enzyme found in virtually all tissues of the body, with particularly high concentrations in the heart, liver, kidneys, skeletal muscle, red blood cells, and lymph nodes. LDH catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate during anaerobic glycolysis. When cells are damaged or destroyed, LDH is released into the bloodstream, making it a sensitive but non-specific marker of tissue injury.

LDH exists as five isoenzymes (LDH-1 through LDH-5), each with distinct tissue distributions. LDH-1 predominates in cardiac and red blood cell tissue, LDH-2 in the reticuloendothelial system, LDH-3 in the lungs, LDH-4 in kidneys and placenta, and LDH-5 in liver and skeletal muscle. While total LDH is most commonly ordered, isoenzyme fractionation can help identify the source of tissue damage.

In clinical practice, LDH is used in the evaluation of hemolytic anemia (where it is markedly elevated due to red blood cell destruction), liver disease, lymphoma staging and prognosis (part of the International Prognostic Index), testicular cancer monitoring, and as a component of workups for myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and megaloblastic anemia. Elevated LDH with low haptoglobin is a hallmark finding in hemolysis.

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Hemolytic Anemia]]
- [[Liver Disease]]
- [[Lymphoma]]
- [[Myocardial Infarction]]
- [[Pulmonary Embolism]]
- [[Megaloblastic Anemia]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Lactate Dehydrogenase]] (biomarker)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- LDH is very non-specific; must be interpreted with other clinical findings
- Hemolyzed blood samples will cause falsely elevated LDH results
- LDH isoenzyme fractionation can help identify tissue source of elevation
- Elevated LDH with low haptoglobin strongly suggests hemolysis
- Strenuous exercise can transiently elevate LDH levels
