description: Adiponectin test measures this anti-inflammatory adipokine hormone produced
  by adipose tissue. Higher levels indicate better insulin sensitivity and lower cardiovascular
  risk. Inversely correlated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

# Adiponectin

## Overview
Adiponectin is an adipokine (fat tissue-derived hormone) that plays a key role in insulin sensitization, anti-inflammatory signaling, and fatty acid oxidation. Unlike most adipokines which increase with obesity, adiponectin levels are paradoxically lower in obese individuals and higher in lean individuals, making it an inverse marker of metabolic health.

Adiponectin exerts its effects by binding to AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 receptors in muscle, liver, and other tissues, activating AMPK (the cell's energy sensor) and PPARα pathways. This results in enhanced glucose uptake, increased fatty acid oxidation, reduced hepatic glucose output, and anti-inflammatory effects on vascular endothelium.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |

| **Category** | Metabolic |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood (serum) |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | Yes |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | No |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Low** | <4 mcg/mL (M), <7 mcg/mL (F) | Metabolic syndrome risk |
| **Normal** | 4-30 mcg/mL (M), 7-30 mcg/mL (F) | Adequate metabolic health |
| **Optimal** | >10 mcg/mL (M), >12 mcg/mL (F) | Good insulin sensitivity |

## Notes
- Results inversely correlated with visceral adiposity
- Women typically have higher levels than men
- Exercise and weight loss increase adiponectin levels
- High-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most metabolically active form
