# Albumin / Globulin Ratio

## Overview
Tested twice a year The albumin-to-globulin ratio compares two major proteins in the blood: albumin, produced by the liver to maintain fluid balance, and globulins, which support immune function and blood clotting. Changes in this ratio can reflect shifts in liver, kidney, or immune activity, offering insight into how the body is producing and using proteins.
