# C-Terminal Telopeptide (CTX / beta-CrossLaps)

## Overview
The C-Terminal Telopeptide (CTX) test, also known as beta-CrossLaps, measures fragments of type I collagen that are released into the bloodstream when osteoclasts resorb bone. Specifically, it detects the beta-isomerized form of the C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen, which is specific to mature bone collagen degradation.

CTX is the most widely used serum marker of bone resorption and has been recommended by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) as the reference bone resorption marker. It is particularly valuable for monitoring response to anti-resorptive therapies (bisphosphonates, denosumab), where a significant decrease (>25-30%) at 3 months predicts long-term treatment efficacy.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Bone Health |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood (serum) |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | Yes (morning fasting, before 10 AM) |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | No |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Premenopausal F** | <573 pg/mL | Normal bone resorption |
| **Postmenopausal F** | <1008 pg/mL | Normal (higher due to estrogen decline) |
| **Men** | <584 pg/mL | Normal bone resorption |
| **On Bisphosphonate** | <200 pg/mL | Adequate treatment response |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Osteoporosis]]
- [[Osteopenia]]
- [[Paget's Disease]]
- [[Hyperparathyroidism]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[CTX]] (biomarker)

### Related Tests
- → [[osteocalcin]] (labtest) - Bone formation marker (complementary)
- → [[vitamin d 25oh]] (labtest) - Vitamin D status affects bone turnover
- → [[calcium]] (labtest) - Calcium homeostasis and bone health

## Notes
- Fasting morning collection is critical (CTX has marked diurnal variation)
- Results should be paired with bone formation markers (P1NP, osteocalcin) for complete picture
- Food intake suppresses CTX by 20-50% for several hours
- Exercise can transiently alter levels
