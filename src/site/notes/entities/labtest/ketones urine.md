# Ketones, Urine

## Overview
Tested twice a year Ketones are energy molecules the body makes when it burns fat for fuel — for example, during fasting, ketogenic diets, or prolonged exercise. This can be a normal response, but high levels of ketones in urine (ketonuria) may also be linked to conditions such as diabetes or kidney disease.
