# Glutathione (Total / Reduced)

## Overview
The glutathione test measures levels of glutathione (GSH), the body's most abundant intracellular antioxidant. Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine that plays essential roles in Phase II liver detoxification, immune cell function, protein and DNA synthesis, and neutralization of reactive oxygen species.

Glutathione exists in two forms: reduced (GSH, the active antioxidant) and oxidized (GSSG, the inactive disulfide form). The GSH/GSSG ratio reflects the cell's redox status and oxidative stress burden. A healthy ratio is typically >100:1. As oxidative stress increases, more GSH is converted to GSSG, lowering the ratio.

Whole blood or erythrocyte glutathione measurement provides the most clinically meaningful assessment, as >98% of glutathione is intracellular. Plasma glutathione levels are very low and less informative.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Antioxidant / Oxidative Stress |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood (whole blood or erythrocytes) |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | Yes (morning sample preferred) |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | No |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Low** | <200 umol/L (whole blood) | Depleted; significant oxidative stress |
| **Normal** | 200-300 umol/L | Adequate antioxidant status |
| **Optimal** | 250-350 umol/L | Robust antioxidant defense |
| **GSH/GSSG Ratio** | >100:1 | Normal redox balance |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]]
- [[Liver Disease]]
- [[Autoimmune Disease]]
- [[Neurodegenerative Disease]]
- [[Cancer]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Glutathione]] (biomarker)

### Related Tests
- → [[nutreval fmv]] (labtest) - May include glutathione assessment
- → [[organic acids test]] (labtest) - Indirect markers of glutathione status

## Notes
- Whole blood measurement is preferred over plasma (>98% is intracellular)
- NAC, liposomal glutathione, and whey protein can raise levels
- Acetaminophen (Tylenol) depletes glutathione significantly
- Exercise initially depletes but chronically upregulates glutathione
- Alcohol, smoking, and chronic stress deplete glutathione
