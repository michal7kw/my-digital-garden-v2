# Neutrophils

## Overview
Tested twice a year Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell (WBC) and act as frontline defenders against infection by engulfing and digesting pathogens. They are produced in the bone marrow and rapidly mobilize to sites of infection or injury, guided by inflammation signals. Changes in neutrophil count—either high (neutrophilia) or low (neutropenia)—can provide important clues about infections, inflammation, or bone-marrow function. The test includes both percentage and absolute levels.
