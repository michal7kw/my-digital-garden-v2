# Osteocalcin

## Overview
Osteocalcin (also known as bone Gla protein or BGP) is a small, non-collagenous protein produced exclusively by osteoblasts during the bone formation process. It is the most abundant non-collagenous protein in bone matrix, comprising approximately 1-2% of total bone protein. Osteocalcin contains gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues that require vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for calcium binding and incorporation into the hydroxyapatite bone matrix.

As a bone formation marker, serum osteocalcin reflects osteoblast activity and overall bone turnover rate. It is used clinically in conjunction with bone resorption markers (such as CTX and NTX) to provide a comprehensive assessment of bone metabolism. In osteoporosis management, osteocalcin is useful for monitoring response to anabolic therapies (teriparatide, romosozumab) where increasing levels indicate successful stimulation of bone formation.

Recent research has also identified endocrine functions of osteocalcin beyond bone metabolism. Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) acts as a hormone that influences glucose metabolism by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, promoting insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue and muscle, and regulating energy expenditure. This metabolic role has made osteocalcin an area of active research in the intersection of bone biology and metabolic disease.

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Osteoporosis]]
- [[Osteopenia]]
- [[Paget's Disease]]
- [[Hyperparathyroidism]]
- [[Renal Osteodystrophy]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Osteocalcin]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[bone health panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory and assay method
- Fasting sample is recommended due to circadian variation (peak in early morning)
- Osteocalcin has significant diurnal variation; sample timing should be consistent
- Vitamin K deficiency reduces carboxylated osteocalcin levels
- Warfarin therapy lowers osteocalcin due to vitamin K antagonism
- Specimen must be processed promptly as osteocalcin is unstable in serum at room temperature
