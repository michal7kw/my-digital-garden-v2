# Troponin I

## Overview
High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) is a cardiac-specific biomarker released into the bloodstream when cardiomyocytes are damaged. It is one of the primary tools used in emergency departments worldwide for the diagnosis or exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The high-sensitivity assay can detect very low concentrations of troponin I, enabling earlier diagnosis of cardiac injury compared to conventional assays.

Troponin I is part of the troponin complex that regulates calcium-mediated contraction of cardiac muscle. Unlike troponin T, troponin I is exclusively expressed in cardiac tissue, making it highly specific for myocardial injury. Serial measurements taken at presentation and 3-6 hours later are used to detect rising or falling patterns that help differentiate acute MI from chronic elevations seen in conditions such as heart failure or chronic kidney disease.

Clinical guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology recommend high-sensitivity troponin assays as the preferred biomarker for evaluating patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The test has transformed chest pain evaluation by enabling rapid rule-out protocols (0/1-hour or 0/3-hour algorithms).

| **Critical** | >10x URL | High probability of acute MI or major cardiac event |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Myocardial Infarction]]
- [[Heart Failure]]
- [[Myocarditis]]
- [[Pulmonary Embolism]]
- [[Cardiac Contusion]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Troponin]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[cardiac biomarker panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory and assay manufacturer
- Serial measurements (0h, 3h, 6h) are essential for ruling in or out acute MI
- Chronic elevations may be seen in renal failure, heart failure, and other conditions
- Sex-specific cutoffs are recommended (females generally have lower 99th percentile values)
