# D-Dimer

## Overview
D-Dimer is a fibrin degradation product, a small protein fragment present in blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. It is named for two crosslinked D fragments of the fibrin protein. The D-Dimer test is primarily used as a screening tool to help rule out thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The test has an extremely high sensitivity (>95%) but relatively low specificity for thromboembolism. A normal D-Dimer result (<500 ng/mL FEU) in a patient with low or moderate clinical probability effectively excludes venous thromboembolism, potentially avoiding the need for imaging studies. However, D-Dimer can be elevated in many non-thrombotic conditions including infection, inflammation, malignancy, pregnancy, recent surgery, trauma, and liver disease.

Age-adjusted D-Dimer cutoffs (age x 10 ng/mL for patients over 50 years) have been validated to improve specificity in elderly patients, reducing unnecessary imaging by 12-30% while maintaining safety. Current guidelines recommend D-Dimer testing in conjunction with validated clinical probability scores such as the Wells score or Geneva score.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Coagulation |
| **Test Type** | Standard |
| **Sample Type** | Blood |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal** | <500 ng/mL FEU | Thromboembolism unlikely (high NPV) |
| **Age-adjusted (>50y)** | <age x 10 ng/mL | Age-adjusted cutoff improves specificity |
| **Elevated** | 500-2000 ng/mL | Possible thromboembolism; imaging recommended |
| **Markedly Elevated** | >2000 ng/mL | High suspicion for DVT/PE or DIC |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Deep Vein Thrombosis]]
- [[Pulmonary Embolism]]
- [[DIC]]
- [[Aortic Dissection]]
- [[Stroke]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[D-Dimer]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[coagulation panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory and assay method (FEU vs DDU units)
- A normal D-Dimer does NOT rule out thrombosis in high clinical probability patients
- D-Dimer is elevated in pregnancy, surgery, trauma, infection, malignancy, and aging
- Age-adjusted cutoffs (age x 10 ng/mL for >50 years) improve specificity
- FEU (Fibrinogen Equivalent Units) values are approximately twice DDU (D-Dimer Units) values
