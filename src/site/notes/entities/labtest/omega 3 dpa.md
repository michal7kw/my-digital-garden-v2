# omega_3_dpa

## Overview
oh-MAY-guh three: D-P-A Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) is an omega-3 fatty acid that the body produces as it converts EPA into DHA—two other important omega-3s that support heart, brain, and immune health. Because DPA can shift between these two forms, it helps maintain the body’s overall omega-3 balance. Measuring DPA provides added insight into how well the body is using omega-3 fats to support inflammation control, cell repair, and cardiovascular health.
