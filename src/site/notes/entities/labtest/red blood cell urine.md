# red_blood_cell_urine

## Overview
Tested twice a year Finding red blood cells (RBCs) in urine, a condition called hematuria, is not normal and can be a sign that the kidneys, bladder, or urinary tract are irritated or damaged. While sometimes it may result from temporary issues like exercise, persistent RBCs in urine can signal the presence of other underlying health concerns.
