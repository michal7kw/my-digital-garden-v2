# zinc

## Overview
Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a key role in immune strength, wound healing, metabolism, and hormone balance. Testing zinc levels shows whether the body has enough to support these functions. Low levels can be linked to issues such as reduced immune response, slower healing, fatigue, or hormonal changes, while adequate levels help keep many biological processes running smoothly.
