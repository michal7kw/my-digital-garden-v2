description: Iron binding capacity shows how well the blood can carry iron by measuring
  the maximum amount of iron that can attach to transferrin, the main iron-transport
  protein. High levels can mean the body needs more iron (like in iron deficiency
  or anemia), while low can happen if there’s too much iron, chronic illness, or poor
  nutrition.

# Iron Binding Capacity

## Overview
Iron binding capacity shows how well the blood can carry iron by measuring the maximum amount of iron that can attach to transferrin, the main iron-transport protein. High levels can mean the body needs more iron (like in iron deficiency or anemia), while low can happen if there’s too much iron, chronic illness, or poor nutrition.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
