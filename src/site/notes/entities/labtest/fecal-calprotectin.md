# Fecal Calprotectin

## Overview
Fecal Calprotectin (FC) is a calcium-binding protein derived predominantly from neutrophils, accounting for approximately 60% of cytosolic protein content in these cells. When neutrophils migrate to inflamed intestinal tissue, calprotectin is released into the intestinal lumen and can be measured in stool samples. This makes it an excellent non-invasive surrogate marker of intestinal inflammation that correlates well with endoscopic and histological findings.

The primary clinical utility of fecal calprotectin is distinguishing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, from functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). With a cutoff of 50 mcg/g, fecal calprotectin has a sensitivity of approximately 93% and specificity of 96% for detecting IBD, making it one of the most accurate non-invasive screening tools available. This high diagnostic accuracy reduces the need for unnecessary colonoscopies in patients with IBS-type symptoms.

In established IBD, fecal calprotectin is used for monitoring disease activity, assessing mucosal healing in response to treatment, predicting relapse (rising levels often precede clinical symptoms by weeks to months), and guiding treatment escalation or de-escalation decisions. Levels below 150 mcg/g generally correlate with endoscopic remission, while levels above 250 mcg/g suggest active mucosal inflammation requiring treatment adjustment.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Gastrointestinal |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Stool |
| **Collection Method** | Stool sample |
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal** | <50 mcg/g | No significant intestinal inflammation |
| **Borderline** | 50-200 mcg/g | Mild inflammation; repeat testing or further evaluation |
| **Elevated** | >200 mcg/g | Significant intestinal inflammation; endoscopy recommended |
| **Markedly Elevated** | >500 mcg/g | Severe inflammation; active IBD highly likely |
| **Remission Target (IBD)** | <150 mcg/g | Correlates with endoscopic mucosal healing |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]]
- [[Crohn's Disease]]
- [[Ulcerative Colitis]]
- [[Irritable Bowel Syndrome]]
- [[Celiac Disease]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Calprotectin]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[gut health comprehensive panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- No fasting required; sample can be collected at any time
- Calprotectin is stable in stool at room temperature for up to 7 days
- NSAIDs and proton pump inhibitors can mildly elevate fecal calprotectin
- Intestinal infections also elevate calprotectin; rule out infectious causes
- Less reliable in children under 4 years (physiologically higher levels)
- Serial monitoring every 3-6 months is recommended for IBD patients in remission
