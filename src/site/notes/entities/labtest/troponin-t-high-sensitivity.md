# Troponin T High Sensitivity

## Overview
High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is considered the gold standard cardiac biomarker for detecting myocardial injury. It measures the cardiac-specific isoform of troponin T, a structural protein involved in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. When cardiomyocytes are damaged or undergo necrosis, troponin T is released into the circulation and can be detected by high-sensitivity immunoassays at extremely low concentrations.

The hs-cTnT assay (primarily manufactured by Roche Diagnostics as the Elecsys platform) has a 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) of 14 ng/L, which serves as the diagnostic threshold for myocardial injury. Values above this threshold, particularly with a rising or falling pattern, are consistent with acute myocardial infarction when accompanied by clinical evidence of ischemia.

Beyond acute coronary syndromes, hs-cTnT has significant prognostic value in chronic heart failure, providing independent risk prediction for adverse cardiovascular events. Chronically elevated levels are commonly seen in patients with structural heart disease, renal insufficiency, and advanced age, and must be distinguished from acute elevations through serial measurement protocols.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Cardiac Panel |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal** | <14 ng/L | No significant myocardial injury detected |
| **Borderline** | 14-52 ng/L | Myocardial injury present; serial testing recommended |
| **Elevated** | >52 ng/L | Significant myocardial injury; high probability of acute MI |
| **Critical** | >140 ng/L (>10x URL) | Major myocardial damage; urgent evaluation required |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Myocardial Infarction]]
- [[Heart Failure]]
- [[Acute Coronary Syndrome]]
- [[Myocarditis]]
- [[Cardiac Contusion]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Troponin]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[cardiac biomarker panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- The 99th percentile URL of 14 ng/L is sex-independent for the Roche Elecsys assay
- Serial measurements at 0h and 3h (or 0h and 1h with high-sensitivity protocols) are essential
- Renal impairment (eGFR <60) commonly causes chronic elevations
- hs-cTnT has longer half-life than hs-cTnI, remaining elevated for 10-14 days after acute MI
