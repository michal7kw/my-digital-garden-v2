# Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)

## Overview
Tested twice a year Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is an enzyme found throughout the body, especially in the liver, heart, and muscles. When these tissues are stressed or damaged, AST can be released into the bloodstream, so higher levels in blood tests may reflect liver, muscle, or heart issues. Because AST can rise for different reasons, it is usually measured alongside other liver enzymes to give a clearer picture of liver health.
