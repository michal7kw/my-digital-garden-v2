# C-Peptide

## Overview
C-Peptide (connecting peptide) is a 31-amino acid polypeptide that is cleaved from proinsulin during the enzymatic processing of insulin in the pancreatic beta cells. For every molecule of insulin produced, one molecule of C-Peptide is released in equimolar amounts into the portal circulation. Because C-Peptide is not extracted by the liver (unlike insulin, which undergoes ~50% first-pass hepatic clearance) and has a longer half-life (approximately 30 minutes vs. 5 minutes for insulin), it serves as a more reliable indicator of endogenous insulin secretion.

The primary clinical applications of C-Peptide testing include differentiating Type 1 diabetes (low or absent C-Peptide due to beta-cell destruction) from Type 2 diabetes (normal or elevated C-Peptide due to insulin resistance with preserved beta-cell function), evaluating residual beta-cell function in insulin-treated patients, diagnosing insulinoma (endogenous hyperinsulinism), and investigating factitious hypoglycemia from exogenous insulin administration (where C-Peptide would be suppressed).

C-Peptide levels are ideally measured in the fasting state for baseline assessment or during a mixed-meal tolerance test or glucagon stimulation test for dynamic evaluation of beta-cell reserve. In Type 1 diabetes, a fasting C-Peptide below 0.2 nmol/L (0.6 ng/mL) indicates near-complete beta-cell failure, while levels above 0.6 nmol/L (1.8 ng/mL) suggest significant residual function.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Metabolic Panel |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | Yes |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Low** | <0.8 ng/mL (fasting) | Reduced insulin production; suggests Type 1 diabetes or late-stage Type 2 |
| **Normal** | 0.8-3.1 ng/mL (fasting) | Adequate endogenous insulin production |
| **Elevated** | >3.1 ng/mL (fasting) | Increased insulin production; suggests insulin resistance or insulinoma |
| **Stimulated Normal** | 5-12 ng/mL | Normal response to glucagon or meal stimulation |

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- Fasting for 8-12 hours is required for accurate baseline measurement
- C-Peptide is not affected by exogenous insulin administration
- Renal impairment can elevate C-Peptide due to reduced clearance (adjust for eGFR)
- Stimulation testing (glucagon or mixed meal) provides more information than fasting levels alone
- Useful for determining insulin therapy need in Type 2 diabetes patients
