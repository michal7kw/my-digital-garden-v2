<h1>C-Peptide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>C-Peptide (connecting peptide) is a 31-amino acid polypeptide that is cleaved from proinsulin during the enzymatic processing of insulin in the pancreatic beta cells. For every molecule of insulin produced, one molecule of C-Peptide is released in equimolar amounts into the portal circulation. Because C-Peptide is not extracted by the liver (unlike insulin, which undergoes ~50% first-pass hepatic clearance) and has a longer half-life (approximately 30 minutes vs. 5 minutes for insulin), it serves as a more reliable indicator of endogenous insulin secretion.</p>
<p>The primary clinical applications of C-Peptide testing include differentiating Type 1 diabetes (low or absent C-Peptide due to beta-cell destruction) from Type 2 diabetes (normal or elevated C-Peptide due to insulin resistance with preserved beta-cell function), evaluating residual beta-cell function in insulin-treated patients, diagnosing insulinoma (endogenous hyperinsulinism), and investigating factitious hypoglycemia from exogenous insulin administration (where C-Peptide would be suppressed).</p>
<p>C-Peptide levels are ideally measured in the fasting state for baseline assessment or during a mixed-meal tolerance test or glucagon stimulation test for dynamic evaluation of beta-cell reserve. In Type 1 diabetes, a fasting C-Peptide below 0.2 nmol/L (0.6 ng/mL) indicates near-complete beta-cell failure, while levels above 0.6 nmol/L (1.8 ng/mL) suggest significant residual function.</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>
<p>Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:</p>
<ul>
<li>[[Type 1 Diabetes]]</li>
<li>[[Type 2 Diabetes]]</li>
<li>[[Insulinoma]]</li>
<li>[[Hypoglycemia]]</li>

</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider</li>
<li>Reference ranges may vary by laboratory</li>
<li>Fasting for 8-12 hours is required for accurate baseline measurement</li>
<li>C-Peptide is not affected by exogenous insulin administration</li>
<li>Renal impairment can elevate C-Peptide due to reduced clearance (adjust for eGFR)</li>
<li>Stimulation testing (glucagon or mixed meal) provides more information than fasting levels alone</li>
<li>Useful for determining insulin therapy need in Type 2 diabetes patients</li>
</ul>
