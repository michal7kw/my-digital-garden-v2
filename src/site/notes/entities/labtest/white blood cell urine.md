# white_blood_cell_urine

## Overview
Tested twice a year White blood cells (WBCs) in urine, known as leukocyturia, indicate the immune system is active in the urinary tract, often helping the body respond to infection or inflammation. When present in significant amounts, urinary WBCs can be associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs), kidney stones, or inflammatory conditions.
