# follicle_stimulating_hormone

## Overview
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is made by the pituitary gland in the brain. In females, it regulates the menstrual cycle and stimulates the ovaries to grow and mature eggs for ovulation. Measuring FSH can provide insight into fertility, ovarian health, perimenopause, menopause, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and causes of irregular periods. This test is not typically run if someone is using hormonal birth control, since these medications alter natural FSH levels and make the results less meaningful.
