# NT-proBNP

## Overview
N-terminal pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) is a 76-amino acid inactive fragment that is cleaved from the proBNP precursor molecule alongside the biologically active BNP. Because NT-proBNP is not cleared by neprilysin (unlike BNP), it has a significantly longer half-life of approximately 120 minutes compared to BNP's 20 minutes, resulting in circulating levels that are 3-5 times higher than BNP and more stable for laboratory measurement.

NT-proBNP is widely used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of heart failure. The test employs age-stratified diagnostic cutoffs: values below 125 pg/mL for patients under 75 years and below 450 pg/mL for patients over 75 years are used to rule out heart failure. For acute heart failure diagnosis, higher age-stratified thresholds apply: 450 pg/mL (<50 years), 900 pg/mL (50-75 years), and 1800 pg/mL (>75 years).

NT-proBNP is the preferred natriuretic peptide assay for patients receiving sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), as this drug inhibits neprilysin and elevates BNP levels but does not affect NT-proBNP. NT-proBNP is cleared primarily by renal excretion, so levels are significantly affected by kidney function and must be interpreted in the context of estimated glomerular filtration rate.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Cardiac Panel |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal (age <75)** | <125 pg/mL | Heart failure unlikely |
| **Normal (age >75)** | <450 pg/mL | Heart failure unlikely (age-adjusted) |
| **Acute HF cutoff (<50y)** | >450 pg/mL | Suggestive of acute heart failure |
| **Acute HF cutoff (50-75y)** | >900 pg/mL | Suggestive of acute heart failure |
| **Acute HF cutoff (>75y)** | >1800 pg/mL | Suggestive of acute heart failure |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Heart Failure]]
- [[Cardiomyopathy]]
- [[Dyspnea]]
- [[Atrial Fibrillation]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[BNP]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[cardiac biomarker panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- NT-proBNP is preferred over BNP for patients on sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto)
- Renal impairment significantly elevates NT-proBNP levels; adjust interpretation for eGFR
- Obesity can lower natriuretic peptide levels
- Useful for guided heart failure management (targeting >30% reduction from baseline)
