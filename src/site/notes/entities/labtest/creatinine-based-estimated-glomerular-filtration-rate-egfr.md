  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a calculation that shows how well
  the kidneys are filtering waste from the blood. Low eGFR can signal reduced kidney
  function or early kidney disease, while healthy levels reflect normal filtering
  ability. Because eGFR is influenced by factors like age and muscle mass, it is often
  reviewed alongside other kidney markers such as creatinine and BUN for a clearer
  picture of kidney health.
