# methylmalonic_acid

## Overview
Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a substance involved in metabolism and energy production. MMA levels rise when vitamin B12 is low, making this one of the most sensitive tests for early or mild B12 deficiency—even before symptoms appear. While elevated MMA usually points to low B12, it can also increase with kidney disease, thyroid problems, dehydration, certain genetic traits, or aging. Finding elevated MMA signals a chance to address diet, supplements, or underlying health issues before problems develop.
