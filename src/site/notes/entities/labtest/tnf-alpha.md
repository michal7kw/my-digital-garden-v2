description: Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-alpha) test measures this key pro-inflammatory
  cytokine in blood. TNF-alpha is produced primarily by activated macrophages and
  plays a central role in systemic inflammation. It is a therapeutic target in rheumatoid
  arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.

# Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α)

## Overview
Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) is a cytokine produced primarily by activated macrophages, though it can also be produced by T cells, NK cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils. It is one of the most potent pro-inflammatory mediators in the body, capable of inducing fever, apoptotic cell death, cachexia, and inflammation.

TNF-α measurement is particularly valuable in monitoring autoimmune conditions where anti-TNF therapies (infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept) are used. It helps guide treatment decisions and assess therapeutic response. Elevated levels are also seen in obesity (adipose tissue is a major source), cardiovascular disease, and chronic infections.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Immunology |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood (serum) |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | No |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal** | <8.1 pg/mL | No significant inflammation |
| **Elevated** | 8.1-15 pg/mL | Mild-moderate inflammation |
| **High** | >15 pg/mL | Significant inflammatory activity |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]
- [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]]
- [[Psoriasis]]
- [[Ankylosing Spondylitis]]
- [[Sepsis]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[TNF Alpha]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[cytokine panel]] (labtestpanel)
- → [[advanced inflammation panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- TNF-α has a short half-life (~20 minutes); sample handling is critical
- Soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR1, sTNFR2) may be more stable alternatives
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
