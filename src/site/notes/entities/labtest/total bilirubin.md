# total_bilirubin

## Overview
Tested twice a year Total bilirubin measures all forms of bilirubin, a yellow substance made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. Normally, the liver processes bilirubin so it can be removed from the body. Measuring total bilirubin provides a broad view of liver function and can help detect liver disease, bile duct problems, or other metabolic concerns.
