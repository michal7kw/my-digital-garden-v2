# Leptin

## Overview
Leptin is called the satiety hormone, and tells the brain when you are full and when to stop eating. It is an important hormone produced by fat cells to regulate metabolism and body weight. High levels often points to leptin resistance, which exacerbates chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, while increasing cardiovascular risk, metabolic issues, and obesity.
