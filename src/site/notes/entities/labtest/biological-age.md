# Biological Age

## Overview
Tested twice a year Biological age reflects how one's body is aging at the cellular and molecular levels, which can determine the risk of age-related conditions like cardiovascular diseases and cognitive decline. Unlike calendar age (number of years lived), biological age is reversible and something one can optimize. It calculates mortality risk and phenotypic age based on various lab test results. While biological age on its own might seem like a vanity metric, when combined with 160+ lab tests, it offers a comprehensive benchmark for tracking and improving overall health.
