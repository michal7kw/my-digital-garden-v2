# LDL Small

## Overview
LDL particles can be small, medium, or large. Smaller, denser particles are considered more harmful because they more easily enter artery walls, promote inflammation, and raise the risk of plaque buildup and cardiovascular disease. Larger particles are less likely to do this and are generally considered less harmful.
