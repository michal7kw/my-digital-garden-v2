# Hematocrit

## Overview
Tested twice a year Hematocrit measures the percentage of red blood cells in the blood—the cells responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. Low levels are most often linked to anemia or blood loss, while high levels may reflect dehydration or conditions that increase red cell production. Tracking hematocrit provides important insight into how well the body is maintaining healthy oxygen delivery.
