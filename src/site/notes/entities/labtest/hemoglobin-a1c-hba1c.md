# Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)

## Overview
Tested twice a year Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measures average blood sugar over 2-3 months and is used to assess diabetes risk and management. Higher levels mean blood sugar has been above normal, raising risks for heart, kidney, and nerve problems, while lower levels reflect better long-term control. Unlike a single glucose test, which shows blood sugar at one moment, HbA1c offers a broader view of balance—both tests are useful, with HbA1c especially important for overall management.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
