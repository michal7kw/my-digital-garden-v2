# amorphous_sediment_urine

## Overview
Tested twice a year Amorphous sediment in urine refers to tiny crystals or particles—such as urates or phosphates—which can appear when urine becomes more concentrated or changes in pH occur. Testing for these sediments can help assess kidney function and may detect conditions such as urinary tract infections, kidney stones, or other disorders that affect how minerals and waste are processed.
