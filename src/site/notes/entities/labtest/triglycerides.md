# Triglycerides

## Overview
Tested twice a year When we eat, the body converts any extra calories, particularly from carbohydrates and sugar, into triglycerides and stores them in the liver and fat cells for energy. High triglycerides often show up with diets high in refined carbohydrates and sugars, a sedentary lifestyle, and insulin resistance, which can raise the risk of heart disease.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
