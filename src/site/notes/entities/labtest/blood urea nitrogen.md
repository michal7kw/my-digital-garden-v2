# blood_urea_nitrogen

## Overview
Tested twice a year Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from urea, a waste product made when the body breaks down protein. BUN is commonly used to check kidney function, since healthy kidneys filter urea out of the blood. Abnormal levels can also be related to dehydration, high protein intake, or certain metabolic or kidney conditions.
