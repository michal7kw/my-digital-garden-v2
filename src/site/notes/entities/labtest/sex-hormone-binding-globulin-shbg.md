description: Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is a protein made by the liver that
  regulates how much estrogen and testosterone are available for the body to use.
  In females, SHBG helps maintain hormone balance and can influence fertility, menstrual
  cycles, and symptoms related to conditions like PCOS or excess hair growth (hirsutism).
  Measuring SHBG provides useful clues about hormone health, particularly when there
  are signs of excess androgens, irregular cycles, or unexplained symptoms.

Measuring SHBG provides useful clues about hormone health, particularly when there are signs of excess androgens, irregular cycles, or unexplained symptoms.
