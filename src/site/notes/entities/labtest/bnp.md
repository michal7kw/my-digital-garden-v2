# BNP

## Overview
B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) is a 32-amino acid polypeptide neurohormone secreted primarily by ventricular cardiomyocytes in response to increased myocardial wall stress from volume overload or pressure overload. It is one of the most clinically important biomarkers for the evaluation of patients with suspected or established heart failure. BNP functions physiologically to promote natriuresis, diuresis, and vasodilation, serving as a counter-regulatory mechanism to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

In the emergency department setting, BNP is used to differentiate cardiac from pulmonary causes of dyspnea. A level below 100 pg/mL has a strong negative predictive value for excluding heart failure as the cause of acute dyspnea. Levels above 400 pg/mL are highly suggestive of heart failure, while values between 100-400 pg/mL represent a gray zone requiring additional clinical evaluation.

BNP also has significant prognostic value in chronic heart failure management, where serial measurements guide treatment optimization, particularly with guideline-directed medical therapy including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Rising BNP levels often precede clinical decompensation, enabling proactive treatment adjustments.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |

| **Normal** | <100 pg/mL | Heart failure unlikely as cause of symptoms |
| **Gray Zone** | 100-400 pg/mL | Intermediate; clinical correlation required |
| **Elevated** | >400 pg/mL | Heart failure highly probable |
| **Note** | Age >75: cutoff <200 pg/mL | Higher cutoffs appropriate for elderly patients |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Heart Failure]]
- [[Dyspnea]]
- [[Cardiomyopathy]]
- [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
- [[Valvular Heart Disease]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[BNP]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[cardiac biomarker panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- BNP has a shorter half-life (~20 minutes) than NT-proBNP, making it more responsive to acute changes
- Obesity can lower BNP levels (adipose tissue expresses neprilysin which degrades BNP)
- Nesiritide (recombinant BNP) therapy will cause falsely elevated BNP levels
- Sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto) increases BNP but decreases NT-proBNP; use NT-proBNP for monitoring
