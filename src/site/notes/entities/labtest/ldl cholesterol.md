# ldl_cholesterol

## Overview
Tested twice a year LDL cholesterol is responsible for carrying cholesterol from the liver to cells throughout the body. Despite its good intentions, LDL is often called “bad” cholesterol, because when it's in excess, it can deposit in artery walls, causing plaque buildup and increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. It’s an important biomarker for assessing cardiovascular risk.
