# iron_saturation

## Overview
Iron saturation measures how much of transferrin (the main iron-carrying protein in the blood) is bound to iron. Normal levels are usually 20-50%. Low saturation often means there isn't enough iron to support healthy red blood cells and energy (anemia), while high levels may suggest excess iron in the body.
