description: ABO group and Rh factor are the two main systems used to determine blood
  type, which is essential for safe blood transfusions, organ transplants, and pregnancy
  care. The ABO system includes four main types—A, B, AB, and O—based on which antigens
  are present on red blood cells. The Rh factor adds a “+” or “–” depending on whether
  the Rh antigen is present. Knowing your ABO and Rh blood type helps avoid dangerous
  reactions and ensures the best possible care as well as providing information if
  you want to donate blood to help others.
