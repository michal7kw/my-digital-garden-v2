description: pros-tate speh-sif-ik an-tih-jen (p-s-a) per-sent free Percent free PSA
  (prostate-specific antigen) measures the share of PSA in the blood that is not attached
  to proteins. This percentage is used alongside other information to help assess
  the likelihood of prostate cancer and to guide decisions about further testing,
  such as a biopsy. It is calculated by dividing free PSA by total PSA and multiplying
  by 100%. Lower values can be associated with a higher likelihood of cancer, while
  higher values are more often linked to non cancerous prostate conditions like enlargement
  or inflammation.
