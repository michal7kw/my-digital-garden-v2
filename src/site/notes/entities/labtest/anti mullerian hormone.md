## Overview
AMH reflects ovarian reserve (egg count) and fertility potential, at the time of the test. This test sheds light on the body’s ability to produce eggs for fertilization, particularly if one is nearing menopause or experiencing a hormonal condition such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI).
