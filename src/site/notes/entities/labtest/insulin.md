# Insulin

## Overview
Tested twice a year Insulin is a hormone that acts like a key, helping sugar in the blood move into cells for energy. Unlike glucose, insulin isn’t routinely tested in standard checkups, but measuring it can sometimes detect signs of diabetes risk even earlier. High insulin levels may mean the body is becoming resistant to insulin, raising the risk for type 2 diabetes, while very low levels may suggest the pancreas isn't making enough, as in type 1 diabetes. Tracking both insulin and glucose gives a fuller picture of metabolic health.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
