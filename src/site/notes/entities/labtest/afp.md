# AFP

## Overview
Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a major plasma protein produced by the fetal liver and yolk sac during embryonic development. In healthy adults, AFP levels are normally very low (<10 ng/mL). Elevated AFP levels in non-pregnant adults are primarily associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), certain germ cell tumors (particularly nonseminomatous testicular cancer and yolk sac tumors), and chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatitis.

In hepatology, AFP is used as a surveillance biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma in high-risk populations, particularly patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B/C infection. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends abdominal ultrasound with or without AFP every 6 months for HCC surveillance. While AFP alone has limited sensitivity (approximately 60% at the 20 ng/mL cutoff), it complements ultrasound imaging for improved detection.

In oncology, AFP is a key component of the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) staging system for testicular cancer. AFP levels, along with beta-hCG and LDH, determine risk classification and guide treatment intensity. AFP has a half-life of approximately 5-7 days, and post-treatment kinetics are monitored to assess treatment adequacy and detect recurrence.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Cancer Screening |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal** | <10 ng/mL | Within normal limits for non-pregnant adults |
| **Mildly Elevated** | 10-20 ng/mL | May indicate chronic liver disease; monitor trend |
| **Elevated** | 20-200 ng/mL | Suspicious for HCC or germ cell tumor; imaging recommended |
| **Markedly Elevated** | >200 ng/mL | Highly suggestive of HCC or germ cell malignancy |
| **Diagnostic for HCC** | >400 ng/mL | Virtually diagnostic for HCC in cirrhotic patient |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Hepatocellular Carcinoma]]
- [[Testicular Cancer]]
- [[Cirrhosis]]
- [[Chronic Hepatitis B]]
- [[Chronic Hepatitis C]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[AFP]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[cancer screening panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- AFP surveillance every 6 months is recommended for patients with cirrhosis
- AFP-L3 (lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP fraction) improves specificity for HCC
- AFP half-life is 5-7 days; post-treatment kinetics guide ongoing management
- Pregnancy causes physiologically elevated AFP (peaks in third trimester)
- Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis can cause mild AFP elevations without malignancy
