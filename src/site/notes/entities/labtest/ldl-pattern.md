# LDL Pattern

## Overview
LDL particle pattern measures whether LDL particles are mostly small and dense (Pattern B) or larger and lighter (Pattern A). Standard LDL tests measure cholesterol by weight, but this test shows particle type. Pattern B is linked to a higher risk of plaque buildup and heart disease, while Pattern A is considered less harmful and more protective.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
