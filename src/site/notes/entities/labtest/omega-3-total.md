# Omega-3 Total

## Overview
Omega-3 Total reflects major omega-3 fatty acids (including EPA, DHA, ALA) that support anti-inflammatory and resolving pathways. Adequate omega-3s help modulate immune responses, support cell membrane fluidity, and counterbalance excessive omega-6 activity. This marker gives insight into how well the body is poised to resolve inflammation and maintain a balanced fatty acid profile.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
