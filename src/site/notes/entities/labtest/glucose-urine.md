# Glucose, Urine

## Overview
Tested twice a year Glucose is normally reabsorbed by the kidneys, so urine is typically free of it under healthy conditions. When glucose spills into the urine (glucosuria), it usually means blood sugar levels are higher than the kidneys can filter, which can indicate diabetes, kidney dysfunction, or metabolic imbalance.
