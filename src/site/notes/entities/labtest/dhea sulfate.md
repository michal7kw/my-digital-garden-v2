# DHEA-Sulfate

## Overview
DHEA-Sulfate (DHEA-S) is one of the most abundant hormones in women and serves as a building block for other hormones, including estrogen and testosterone. Measuring DHEA-S can provide insight into reproductive function, adrenal gland health, and overall hormone balance. Levels that are too high or too low may prompt further testing, as DHEA-S has also been linked with aspects of immune health, longevity, and healthy aging.
