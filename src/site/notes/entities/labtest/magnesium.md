# Magnesium

## Overview
Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in hundreds of processes in the body, including building strong bones, maintaining a steady heart rhythm, supporting muscle function, and producing energy. Nearly half of U.S. adults don't get enough magnesium from food, making low levels relatively common. Deficiency can disrupt calcium and potassium balance and may lead to muscle cramps, weakness, or heart problems.
