# Specific Gravity, Urine

## Overview
Tested twice a year Urine specific gravity measures how concentrated or diluted urine is compared to water, providing insight into hydration status and kidney function. Abnormal readings—either too low or too high—can be associated with conditions such as dehydration, kidney stones, or impaired kidney function.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
