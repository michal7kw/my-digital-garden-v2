# luteinizing_hormone

## Overview
Luteinizing hormone (LH) is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. In females, it helps regulate the menstrual cycle, triggers ovulation (the release of a mature egg), and supports early pregnancy by stimulating the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. Measuring LH can provide insight into fertility, ovarian health, menopause, and conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or irregular cycles. This test is not typically run if someone is using hormonal birth control, since these medications alter natural LH levels and make the results less meaningful.
