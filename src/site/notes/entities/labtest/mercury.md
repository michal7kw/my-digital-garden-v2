# mercury

## Overview
Mercury is a heavy metal that can be toxic in high amounts. Exposure most often happens from eating seafood high in methylmercury (tuna, swordfish, and shark), from breathing in mercury vapor from broken thermometers or fluorescent bulbs, or less commonly from dental fillings. When levels get too high, mercury can affect the brain, kidneys, and nervous system, sometimes causing symptoms such as tremors or headaches. The test helps detect recent or ongoing exposure, so steps can be taken to lower risk or prevent further harm.
