# Hemoglobin

## Overview
Tested twice a year Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, supporting energy and healthy organ function. Low hemoglobin may indicate anemia due to vitamin deficiencies, blood loss, or chronic disease, and is often linked with tiredness or weakness. Higher hemoglobin levels can be seen with dehydration or certain blood disorders.
