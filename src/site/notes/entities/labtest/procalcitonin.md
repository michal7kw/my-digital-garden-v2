# Procalcitonin

## Overview
Procalcitonin (PCT) is a 116-amino acid precursor peptide of calcitonin that is produced by C-cells of the thyroid gland under normal conditions. In the presence of systemic bacterial infection, procalcitonin is produced by virtually all tissues and organs in the body through an alternative pathway induced by bacterial endotoxins and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta). This makes it a highly specific marker for bacterial infection, distinguishing it from viral infections where PCT levels typically remain low.

PCT levels begin to rise within 2-4 hours of bacterial infection onset, peak at 12-24 hours, and have a plasma half-life of 25-30 hours. This kinetic profile makes PCT valuable for both early detection of bacterial infection and monitoring treatment response. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend procalcitonin-guided antibiotic stewardship to help clinicians decide when to initiate and, more importantly, when to discontinue antibiotic therapy.

Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic stewardship reduces antibiotic exposure by 2-3 days in ICU patients without increasing mortality or treatment failure rates. This approach is particularly valuable in the context of antimicrobial resistance, where unnecessary antibiotic use contributes to the development of resistant organisms.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Infection Marker |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal** | <0.1 ng/mL | Bacterial infection very unlikely |
| **Low risk** | 0.1-0.25 ng/mL | Bacterial infection unlikely; antibiotics discouraged |
| **Possible infection** | 0.25-0.5 ng/mL | Possible bacterial infection; consider antibiotics |
| **Likely infection** | 0.5-2.0 ng/mL | Bacterial infection likely; antibiotics recommended |
| **Severe/Sepsis** | >2.0 ng/mL | Severe bacterial infection or sepsis; urgent treatment |
| **Septic shock** | >10 ng/mL | Severe sepsis or septic shock; high mortality risk |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Sepsis]]
- [[Bacterial Infection]]
- [[Pneumonia]]
- [[Meningitis]]
- [[Urinary Tract Infection]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Procalcitonin]] (biomarker)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- PCT is more specific for bacterial infection than CRP or WBC count
- PCT remains low in most viral infections and autoimmune conditions
- False elevations can occur after major surgery, trauma, burns, and in neonates
- Serial measurements (daily) are recommended for antibiotic stewardship decisions
- A >80% decline from peak suggests successful treatment and supports antibiotic de-escalation
