# CA-125

## Overview
Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) is a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein encoded by the MUC16 gene and expressed on the surface of epithelial cells derived from coelomic epithelium, including the peritoneum, pleura, pericardium, and Mullerian epithelium. It is the most extensively studied biomarker for epithelial ovarian cancer, present at elevated levels in approximately 80% of advanced-stage ovarian cancers and 50% of early-stage cases.

CA-125 has primary clinical utility in monitoring treatment response in patients with known ovarian cancer, where declining levels during chemotherapy correlate with tumor response, and rising levels often precede clinical relapse by several months. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI), which combines CA-125 levels with ultrasound findings and menopausal status, is used to triage women with adnexal masses to appropriate surgical care.

CA-125 is not recommended for routine ovarian cancer screening in the general population due to insufficient specificity. Many benign conditions can cause CA-125 elevation, including endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine fibroids, menstruation, pregnancy, liver disease, heart failure, and other malignancies. In postmenopausal women with pelvic masses, however, CA-125 adds significant diagnostic value.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Test Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Category** | Cancer Screening |
| **Test Type** | Specialized |
| **Sample Type** | Blood |
| **Collection Method** | Venipuncture |
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **HSA Eligible** | Yes |
| **FSA Eligible** | Yes |

## Reference Ranges

| Range | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Normal** | <35 U/mL | Within normal limits |
| **Mildly Elevated** | 35-65 U/mL | May indicate benign condition; clinical correlation needed |
| **Elevated** | 65-200 U/mL | Suspicious; further evaluation with imaging recommended |
| **Markedly Elevated** | >200 U/mL | Highly suspicious for ovarian malignancy |

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Ovarian Cancer]]
- [[Endometriosis]]
- [[Pelvic Inflammatory Disease]]
- [[Peritoneal Carcinomatosis]]
- [[Uterine Cancer]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[CA 125]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[cancer screening panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory
- NOT recommended for routine ovarian cancer screening in asymptomatic women
- Premenopausal women have more variation and more benign causes of elevation
- Serial measurements are critical for monitoring treatment response
- CA-125 half-life is approximately 5 days; levels should halve with each chemotherapy cycle
- ROMA (Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm) combines CA-125 with HE4 for improved accuracy
