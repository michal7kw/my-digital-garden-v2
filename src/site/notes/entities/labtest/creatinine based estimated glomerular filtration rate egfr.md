# Creatinine-based Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)

## Overview
ess-tih-may-tid gloh-mer-yoo-lur fil-tray-shun rayt Tested twice a year Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a calculation that shows how well the kidneys are filtering waste from the blood. Low eGFR can signal reduced kidney function or early kidney disease, while healthy levels reflect normal filtering ability. Because eGFR is influenced by factors like age and muscle mass, it is often reviewed alongside other kidney markers such as creatinine and BUN for a clearer picture of kidney health.
