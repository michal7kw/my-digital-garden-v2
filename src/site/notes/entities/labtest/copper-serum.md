description: Serum copper test measures the total copper concentration in blood. Copper
  is an essential trace mineral required as a cofactor for over 30 enzymes. The test
  helps diagnose copper deficiency, Wilson's disease, and monitor copper supplementation.
  Should be interpreted alongside ceruloplasmin and zinc levels.

# Copper (Serum)

## Overview
The serum copper test measures total copper in blood, approximately 95% of which is bound to the transport protein ceruloplasmin. The remaining 5% is "free copper" (non-ceruloplasmin-bound), which is the biologically active and potentially toxic fraction.

This test is essential for diagnosing copper metabolism disorders. In Wilson's disease, total serum copper is typically low (due to reduced ceruloplasmin), but free copper is elevated, causing toxic copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other organs. Copper deficiency, which can occur from zinc over-supplementation, malabsorption, or gastric bypass surgery, causes a triad of anemia, neutropenia, and myelopathy.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Wilson's Disease]]
- [[Copper Deficiency]]
- [[Menkes Disease]]

## Notes
- Always interpret alongside ceruloplasmin and zinc levels
- Copper is an acute-phase reactant; levels rise with inflammation, infection, pregnancy
- Oral contraceptives and estrogen therapy increase serum copper
- Calculate copper:zinc ratio for comprehensive assessment
