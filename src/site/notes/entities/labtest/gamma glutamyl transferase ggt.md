# gamma_glutamyl_transferase_ggt

## Overview
Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is an enzyme found in the liver and bile ducts that plays a role in processing toxins and medications. Elevated GGT levels in the blood can signal stress or damage to the liver or bile ducts, so this test is often used alongside other liver enzymes to give a clearer picture of liver health.
