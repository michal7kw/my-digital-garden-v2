# Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)

## Overview
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is made by the pituitary gland and signals the thyroid to produce T4 and T3. Because TSH rises when thyroid hormone levels are low and falls when they are high, measuring TSH is one of the most useful ways to assess whether the thyroid is underactive, overactive, or functioning normally.
