# Lipase

## Overview
Lipase is a digestive enzyme made by the pancreas that helps break down dietary fats. Elevated levels can indicate pancreatic stress or inflammation (pancreatitis) and may also be associated with conditions affecting the pancreas, gallbladder, or digestive system. Lipase is often tested together with amylase to provide a clearer picture of pancreatic health.
