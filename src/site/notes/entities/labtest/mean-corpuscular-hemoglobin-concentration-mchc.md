# Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)

## Overview
meen kor-pus-kyoo-lur hee-muh-gloh-bin kon-sen-tray-shun (m-c-h-c) Tested twice a year Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) measures the average amount of hemoglobin—the protein that carries oxygen—in each red blood cell. Low MCH often points to iron deficiency anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, or pale skin, while high MCH may indicate a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Measuring MCH helps identify the type of anemia and guide treatment.
