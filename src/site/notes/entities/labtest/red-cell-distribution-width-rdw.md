# Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

## Overview
red sell dis-trib-yoo-shun width (r-d-w) Tested twice a year Red cell distribution width (RDW) measures how much red blood cell sizes vary in the blood. A higher RDW means the cells differ more in size than usual, which can be linked to nutrient deficiencies (like iron, vitamin B12, or folate), certain types of anemia, or other health conditions. RDW is most useful when combined with other blood tests, such as hemoglobin and MCV, to help uncover the cause of anemia and related symptoms like fatigue or weakness.
