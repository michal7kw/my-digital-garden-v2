# high_sensitivity_c_reactive_protein_hs_crp

## Overview
high-sen-sih-tiv see-ree-ak-tiv pro-teen (h-s c-r-p) Tested twice a year High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) can reveal even small amounts of inflammation in the body, making it a powerful tool for understanding risk for diseases linked to long-term inflammation. Chronic inflammation is connected to nearly every major health problem—including heart disease (even before there are symptoms), type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s, depression, autoimmune conditions, and severe allergies like asthma. Elevated hs-CRP levels can signal higher risk for these issues, while normal results suggest lower risk, though the test does not show the exact cause of the inflammation.
