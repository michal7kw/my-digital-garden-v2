# Arachidonic Acid/EPA Ratio

## Overview
uh-rak-ih-don-ik as-id / e-p-a ray-shee-oh The AA/EPA ratio measures the balance between arachidonic acid (AA), a pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acid. A higher ratio means the body may be more prone to fueling inflammation rather than resolving it, making this an important marker for understanding the body's inflammatory environment.
