description: Tested twice a year Nitrites in urine can form when bacteria in the urinary
  tract convert naturally occurring nitrates into nitrites. Because nitrites in urine
  are not normally present in healthy individuals, their presence can serve as a marker
  that bacteria are present somewhere along the urinary tract, making it a useful
  marker for urinary tract infections.
