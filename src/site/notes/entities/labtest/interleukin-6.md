description: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine test that measures
  the level of IL-6 in blood. IL-6 is a key mediator of the acute-phase response and
  is elevated in infections, autoimmune conditions, cardiovascular disease, and various
  cancers. It stimulates hepatic production of CRP and other acute-phase proteins.

# Interleukin-6 (IL-6)

## Overview
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by T cells, B cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. It plays a central role in the transition from innate to adaptive immunity and is the primary driver of hepatic acute-phase protein production, including CRP, fibrinogen, and hepcidin.

This test measures circulating IL-6 levels in blood and is valuable for assessing the intensity of systemic inflammatory responses. Unlike CRP which is a downstream marker, IL-6 provides a more proximal measure of inflammatory signaling. IL-6 levels can rise within hours of an inflammatory stimulus and correlate with disease severity in sepsis, COVID-19, rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular events.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Recommended For

### Conditions
Useful for monitoring or diagnosing:
- [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]
- [[Sepsis]]
- [[Cardiovascular Disease]]

## Relationships
### Measures
- → [[Interleukin 6]] (biomarker)

### Included In
- → [[cytokine panel]] (labtestpanel)
- → [[advanced inflammation panel]] (labtestpanel)

## Notes
- Results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider
- IL-6 has significant diurnal variation (higher in evening)
- Exercise transiently increases IL-6 (anti-inflammatory myokine effect)
- Reference ranges may vary by laboratory and assay method
