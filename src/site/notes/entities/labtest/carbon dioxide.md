# Carbon Dioxide

## Overview
Tested twice a year Carbon dioxide levels monitor pH and are an indirect measure of bicarbonate, a key buffer involved in maintaining the body’s acid-base balance. When the body’s acid–base balance is thrown off—called acidosis or alkalosis—carbon dioxide levels might change in an attempt to compensate for the altered acid–base balance.
