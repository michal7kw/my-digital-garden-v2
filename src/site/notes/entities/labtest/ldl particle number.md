# ldl_particle_number

## Overview
LDL particle number measures how many LDL particles are circulating in the blood. Standard LDL cholesterol tests estimate the amount of cholesterol by weight, while particle tests count the actual number of cholesterol-carrying particles. A higher particle number means more opportunities for cholesterol to enter artery walls and form plaque, which can raise the risk of heart disease and stroke.
