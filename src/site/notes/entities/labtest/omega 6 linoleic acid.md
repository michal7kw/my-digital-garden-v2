# omega_6_linoleic_acid

## Overview
Linoleic acid (LA) is an essential omega-6 fatty acid and the primary dietary precursor to arachidonic acid (AA). While necessary for cell structure and energy, excessive levels of LA can increase AA production and promote inflammation, making this valuable for understanding fatty acid balance and long-term health.
