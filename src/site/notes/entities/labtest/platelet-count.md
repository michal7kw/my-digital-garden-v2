# Platelet Count

## Overview
Tested twice a year Platelet count measures the number of platelets—tiny blood cells that help blood clot and support healing. Low counts (thrombocytopenia) can make bruising or bleeding more noticeable, while high counts (thrombocytosis) may reflect increased clotting activity. This test provides useful information about overall clotting health and can also give clues about conditions such as anemia, infections, or the effects of certain medicines.

**Evidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
