# alkaline_phosphatase_alp

## Overview
Tested twice a year Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in the liver, bones, and other tissues that helps break down proteins and support growth. Abnormal ALP levels can point to conditions affecting the liver, bones, or nutrition status. ALP is often interpreted alongside other liver tests (such as AST, ALT, and bilirubin) to give a clearer picture of liver and bone health.
