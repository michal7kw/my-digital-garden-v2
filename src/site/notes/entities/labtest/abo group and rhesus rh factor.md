# ABO Group and Rhesus (Rh) Factor

## Overview
ABO group and Rh factor are the two main systems used to determine blood type, which is essential for safe blood transfusions, organ transplants, and pregnancy care. The ABO system includes four main types—A, B, AB, and O—based on which antigens are present on red blood cells. The Rh factor adds a “+” or “–” depending on whether the Rh antigen is present. Knowing your ABO and Rh blood type helps avoid dangerous reactions and ensures the best possible care as well as providing information if you want to donate blood to help others.
