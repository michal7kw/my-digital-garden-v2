# Total Cholesterol / HDL Ratio

## Overview
toh-tul koh-les-ter-ol / h-d-l ray-shee-oh Tested twice a year The ratio shows the balance between harmful cholesterol particles that cause plaque buildup in arteries, and protective cholesterol particles that help remove excess cholesterol from the blood. A higher ratio is typically associated with a higher risk of future cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke.
