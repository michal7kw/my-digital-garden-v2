# Creatinine

## Overview
Tested twice a year Creatinine is a waste product made as muscles use energy, both during everyday activity and exercise. Because muscles are always active to some degree, creatinine is produced at a steady rate. Healthy kidneys filter it out of the blood, so measuring blood creatinine is a key way to assess kidney function. Abnormal levels may indicate kidney stress, reduced kidney function, or, in some cases, other health conditions affecting muscle or metabolism. Possible symptoms CHANGES IN URINATION SWELLING IN LEGS OR ANKLES
