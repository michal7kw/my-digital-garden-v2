# Caloric Restriction

## Overview

Caloric Restriction (CR) is the reduction of caloric intake below ad libitum (free-feeding) levels while maintaining adequate nutrition. It is the most well-studied and consistently effective intervention for extending lifespan across species, from yeast and worms to rodents and primates.

Typical CR protocols involve reducing caloric intake by 20-40% compared to normal consumption while ensuring adequate intake of protein, vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids. The key is restriction of total energy, not specific macronutrients.

The landmark CALERIE trial (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy) demonstrated that even modest CR (11.9% actual reduction) in healthy non-obese humans produced metabolic benefits including reduced markers of cardiovascular disease risk, improved insulin sensitivity, and decreased oxidative stress.

## Mechanism of Action

CR triggers a coordinated metabolic response that shifts the body from growth/reproduction to maintenance/repair:

### Nutrient Sensing Pathways

1. **AMPK Activation**: Low energy status activates AMP-activated protein kinase
2. **Sirtuin Upregulation**: Increased NAD+/NADH ratio activates SIRT1, SIRT3
3. **mTOR Inhibition**: Reduced amino acids and growth factors suppress mTOR
4. **Insulin/IGF-1 Reduction**: Lower circulating insulin and IGF-1 levels

### Cellular Effects

- **Enhanced Autophagy**: Increased cellular cleanup and recycling
- **Improved Mitochondrial Function**: Better oxidative capacity, reduced ROS
- **Reduced Inflammation**: Decreased NF-kB activity and inflammatory cytokines
- **DNA Repair Enhancement**: Increased repair enzyme activity
- **Stem Cell Maintenance**: Preserved regenerative capacity

## Protocol

### Standard CR Protocol

- **Reduction Level**: 20-30% below calculated energy needs
- **Nutrient Adequacy**: Meet all micronutrient RDAs
- **Protein Intake**: Maintain at 0.8-1.0 g/kg body weight
- **Implementation**: Gradual reduction over weeks to months

### Modified Approaches

- **Every Other Day Fasting**: Alternate between CR and normal eating
- **5:2 Diet**: 5 normal days, 2 days of severe restriction (~500 kcal)
- **Time-Restricted Eating**: Limit eating window while naturally reducing intake

## Research Summary

### Lifespan Extension Evidence

| Species | Lifespan Extension | Study |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Yeast | Up to 50% | Kaeberlein et al., 2005 |
| C. elegans | Up to 50% | Lakowski & Hekimi, 1998 |
| Drosophila | 30-50% | Partridge et al., 2005 |
| Mice | 30-40% | Weindruch & Walford, 1988 |
| Rhesus Monkeys | 30% mortality reduction | Colman et al., 2009 |

### Human Studies

- **CALERIE Trial** (PMID: 26278052): 2 years of CR improved cardiometabolic markers
- **Biosphere 2** (PMID: 12079842): Unintentional CR showed metabolic improvements
- **Okinawan Centenarians**: Historically practiced moderate lifelong CR

## Safety Information

### Monitoring Requirements

- Regular body composition assessment
- Bone density monitoring (DEXA)
- Complete metabolic panel
- Hormone levels (thyroid, sex hormones)
- Nutritional status assessment

### Risk Mitigation

- Ensure adequate protein intake
- Supplement micronutrients as needed
- Maintain resistance exercise
- Monitor psychological wellbeing
