# Sleep Optimization

## Overview
Sleep is increasingly recognized as critical for brain health and neurodegeneration prevention. During sleep, particularly slow-wave sleep (SWS), the glymphatic system clears metabolic waste including amyloid-beta and tau. Sleep also supports memory consolidation, synaptic homeostasis, and immune function. Poor sleep is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and increased dementia risk.

## Sleep and Brain Health

### Glymphatic System
- Brain's waste clearance system
- Most active during sleep (especially SWS)
- Clears amyloid-beta, tau, and other toxins
- Interstitial space expands 60% during sleep
- Impaired by sleep deprivation

### Memory Consolidation
- **Slow-wave sleep**: Declarative memory consolidation
- **REM sleep**: Procedural and emotional memory
- Hippocampal-cortical transfer
- Synaptic replay and strengthening

### Synaptic Homeostasis
- Synapses potentiate during waking
- Sleep downscales synaptic strength
- Prepares brain for new learning
- Energy restoration

## Sleep and Neurodegeneration

### Alzheimer's Disease
- **Bidirectional relationship**: Poor sleep → amyloid; amyloid → poor sleep
- Single night sleep deprivation increases CSF Aβ
- Sleep apnea increases AD risk
- Sleep disturbance common in AD patients

### Parkinson's Disease
- REM sleep behavior disorder often precedes motor symptoms
- Sleep fragmentation common
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Sleep pathology part of prodromal phase

### General Cognitive Decline
- Short sleep (<6h) and long sleep (>9h) associated with decline
- Poor sleep quality accelerates brain aging
- Chronic insomnia increases dementia risk

## Sleep Architecture

### Normal Adult Sleep Stages

| Stage | Percentage | Function |
|-------|------------|----------|
| N1 (Light) | 5% | Transition |
| N2 (Light) | 45-55% | Spindles; memory |
| N3 (Deep/SWS) | 15-25% | Glymphatic; restoration |
| REM | 20-25% | Dreaming; emotional processing |

### Age-Related Changes
- SWS decreases with age (↓ glymphatic clearance)
- More awakenings (fragmentation)
- Earlier sleep timing (advanced phase)
- Less REM sleep

## Optimization Strategies

### Sleep Hygiene

#### Environment
- **Dark room**: Blackout curtains; <1 lux
- **Cool temperature**: 65-68°F (18-20°C)
- **Quiet**: White noise if needed
- **Comfortable bedding**: Quality mattress, pillows

#### Timing
- **Consistent schedule**: Same time daily (±30 min)
- **7-9 hours** for adults
- **Avoid late sleeping in**: Maintains circadian rhythm

#### Pre-Sleep Routine
- **Wind-down period**: 30-60 minutes
- **No screens**: 1-2 hours before bed (blue light)
- **Relaxation**: Reading, meditation, gentle stretching
- **Avoid stimulation**: No work, arguments, intense exercise

### Lifestyle Factors

#### Light Exposure
- **Morning light**: 10-30 min bright light on waking
- **Circadian entrainment**: Outdoor light during day
- **Evening dim**: Reduce light 2-3 hours before bed
- **Blue light blockers**: If screen use unavoidable

#### Exercise
- Regular exercise improves sleep quality
- **Morning/afternoon** exercise optimal
- Avoid vigorous exercise <2-3 hours before bed
- Even light activity beneficial

#### Diet and Substances
| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Caffeine | None after 12-2 PM |
| Alcohol | Minimize; disrupts REM, causes awakenings |
| Heavy meals | Avoid 2-3 hours before bed |
| Hydration | Limit fluids 1-2 hours before bed |

### Sleep Disorders to Address

#### Sleep Apnea
- Highly prevalent in older adults
- Strong dementia risk factor
- **CPAP treatment**: May improve cognition
- Screening recommended

#### Insomnia
- CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia)
- First-line treatment; more effective than medications
- Sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring

#### Circadian Rhythm Disorders
- Light therapy
- Melatonin timing
- Chronotherapy if severe

## CBT-I Components

### Sleep Restriction
- Match time in bed to actual sleep time
- Gradually increase as efficiency improves
- Consolidates sleep

### Stimulus Control
- Bed only for sleep and intimacy
- Leave bed if awake >20 minutes
- No clock-watching

### Cognitive Restructuring
- Address sleep-related anxiety
- Realistic sleep expectations
- Reduce catastrophizing

### Relaxation Training
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Deep breathing
- Mindfulness meditation

## Monitoring

### Sleep Diary
- Bedtime, wake time
- Estimated sleep time
- Awakenings
- Subjective quality

### Wearables
- Useful for trends
- Not as accurate as polysomnography
- Track consistency, not just duration
