# Mediterranean Diet

## Overview
The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is a dietary pattern based on traditional eating habits of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, particularly Greece, Italy, and Spain. Characterized by high intake of plant foods, olive oil as the primary fat source, moderate fish and wine consumption, and low intake of red meat and processed foods, it is among the most extensively researched dietary patterns with consistent benefits for cardiovascular and brain health.

## Core Components

### Emphasized (Daily)
| Food Group | Servings | Examples |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Vegetables | 3-6 servings | Leafy greens, tomatoes, peppers |
| Fruits | 2-3 servings | Citrus, berries, figs |
| Whole grains | 3-6 servings | Whole wheat, oats, brown rice |
| Olive oil | 3-4 tablespoons | Extra virgin preferred |
| Legumes | Daily-weekly | Lentils, chickpeas, beans |
| Nuts/seeds | Daily | Almonds, walnuts, seeds |
| Herbs/spices | Liberal | Oregano, basil, garlic |

### Emphasized (Weekly)
| Food Group | Servings | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Fish/seafood | 2-3+ times/week | Fatty fish preferred |
| Poultry | 2-4 times/week | Moderate amounts |
| Eggs | 2-4 per week | Traditional |
| Dairy | Moderate | Yogurt, cheese; fermented |

### Limited/Avoided
- Red meat: Occasional (few times monthly)
- Processed meats: Rarely
- Refined grains: Minimize
- Added sugars: Limited
- Processed foods: Minimize

### Optional
- **Red wine**: Up to 1 glass/day with meals (if consumed)
- Controversial; not recommended to start for non-drinkers

## MIND Diet Variant

### Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay
- Hybrid of Mediterranean and DASH diets
- Specifically designed for brain health
- Emphasizes berries and leafy greens
- Strong dementia risk reduction (53% in observational studies)

### MIND-Specific Foods
- Berries: 2+ servings/week (especially blueberries)
- Green leafy vegetables: 6+ servings/week
- Other vegetables: 1+ serving/day
- Nuts: 5+ servings/week
- Beans: 3+ servings/week
- Whole grains: 3+ servings/day
- Fish: 1+ serving/week
- Poultry: 2+ servings/week
- Olive oil: Primary cooking fat
- Wine: 1 glass/day (optional)

## Key Bioactive Components

### Olive Oil (EVOO)
- **Oleic acid**: Monounsaturated fat; anti-inflammatory
- **Polyphenols**: Oleocanthal, hydroxytyrosol
- **Oleocanthal**: Similar to ibuprofen; anti-inflammatory

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids
- From fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel)
- DHA critical for brain structure
- Anti-inflammatory; reduces neuroinflammation

### Polyphenols
- Flavonoids from fruits, vegetables
- Resveratrol from red wine/grapes
- Anthocyanins from berries
- Neuroprotective, antioxidant

### Fiber
- Prebiotic effects
- Gut-brain axis support
- Reduces systemic inflammation

## Clinical Evidence

### PREDIMED Trial
- **6.5 years** follow-up; 7,447 participants
- MedDiet + EVOO or nuts vs. low-fat control
- **30% reduction** in cardiovascular events
- **Cognitive substudy**: Better cognitive function

### PREDIMED-Plus
- MedDiet + caloric restriction + exercise
- Ongoing; enhanced metabolic benefits

### Observational Studies
- Higher adherence → lower dementia risk
- 30-40% reduction in cognitive decline
- Dose-response relationship

## Mechanisms of Benefit

### Cardiovascular
- Reduces LDL oxidation
- Improves endothelial function
- Lowers blood pressure
- Reduces inflammation (CRP, IL-6)

### Neuroprotective
- Reduces neuroinflammation
- Supports cerebral blood flow
- Provides antioxidant protection
- Promotes BDNF expression

### Metabolic
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- Reduces metabolic syndrome
- Supports healthy weight

### Gut-Brain Axis
- Favorable microbiome changes
- Short-chain fatty acid production
- Reduced intestinal permeability

## Practical Implementation

### Getting Started
1. Switch to extra virgin olive oil for cooking
2. Add daily salad or vegetable dish
3. Replace red meat with fish 2-3x/week
4. Snack on nuts instead of processed foods
5. Include legumes several times weekly

### Shopping List Essentials
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Canned/dried legumes
- Nuts (almonds, walnuts)
- Canned fish (sardines, salmon)
- Frozen vegetables
- Whole grains
- Fresh herbs

### Meal Pattern
- **Breakfast**: Whole grain bread, olive oil, tomato, fruit
- **Lunch**: Large salad with legumes, olive oil dressing
- **Dinner**: Grilled fish or poultry, vegetables, whole grain
- **Snacks**: Nuts, fruit, yogurt

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Cost | Legumes and seasonal vegetables are affordable |
| Time | Batch cook legumes; use frozen vegetables |
| Family resistance | Gradual changes; shared meals |
| Dining out | Choose Mediterranean restaurants; fish options |
