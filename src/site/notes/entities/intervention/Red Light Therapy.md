# Red Light Therapy

## Overview
Red light therapy, also known as photobiomodulation (PBM), uses red and near-infrared light to deliver therapeutic benefits. It works by stimulating cellular function, particularly within the mitochondria, to improve energy production, reduce inflammation, and accelerate healing.

## Properties
```yaml
intervention_type: Light Therapy
mechanism_of_action: Penetrates skin to stimulate mitochondria, promoting ATP production, reducing inflammation, and enhancing cellular repair.
dosing_protocol: Varies; typically 10-20 minutes per session, 3-5 times per week.
contraindications:
  - Photosensitivity
  - Active skin conditions (e.g., severe eczema)
  - Pregnancy (consult physician)
side_effects:
  - Mild redness or irritation (rare)
  - Eye strain (if unprotected)
interactions: None significant known; may enhance effects of some topical treatments.
duration: Acute or chronic depending on condition; often used long-term for chronic issues.
frequency: Daily or multiple times per week for optimal results.
timing: Can be used anytime; morning or evening sessions may affect circadian rhythm.
