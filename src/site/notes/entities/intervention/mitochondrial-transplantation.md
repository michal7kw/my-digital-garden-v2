# Mitochondrial Transplantation

## Overview

**Mitochondrial Transplantation** (or Mitotherapy) is an emerging therapeutic strategy involving the transfer of viable mitochondria into compromised tissues. Originally developed to rescue heart tissue after a heart attack, it is now being explored for systemic rejuvenation and anti-aging.

## Methods

1.  **Direct Injection:** Into the affected tissue (e.g., heart muscle).
2.  **Systemic Infusion:** Intravenous delivery (mitochondria are surprisingly taken up by cells via endocytosis or macropinocytosis).
3.  **Bioreactor Production:** Growing mitochondria ex vivo for transplantation.

## Applications

- **Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury:** Reduces damage in heart attacks and strokes.
- **Aging:** Replacing the "tired," mutated mitochondrial pool in older adults to reverse sarcopenia and cognitive decline.
- **Rare Diseases:** Treating primary mitochondrial disorders.
