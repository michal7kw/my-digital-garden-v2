<h1>Mitochondrial Transplantation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Mitochondrial Transplantation</strong> (or Mitotherapy) is an emerging therapeutic strategy involving the transfer of viable mitochondria into compromised tissues. Originally developed to rescue heart tissue after a heart attack, it is now being explored for systemic rejuvenation and anti-aging.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Direct Injection:</strong> Into the affected tissue (e.g., heart muscle).</li>
<li><strong>Systemic Infusion:</strong> Intravenous delivery (mitochondria are surprisingly taken up by cells via endocytosis or macropinocytosis).</li>
<li><strong>Bioreactor Production:</strong> Growing mitochondria ex vivo for transplantation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury:</strong> Reduces damage in heart attacks and strokes.</li>
<li><strong>Aging:</strong> Replacing the &quot;tired,&quot; mutated mitochondrial pool in older adults to reverse sarcopenia and cognitive decline.</li>
<li><strong>Rare Diseases:</strong> Treating primary mitochondrial disorders.</li>
</ul>
