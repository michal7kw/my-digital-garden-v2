description: Evaluates intestinal inflammation, permeability, and microbiome health.
  Fecal calprotectin distinguishes IBD from IBS, while GI-MAP provides comprehensive
  stool analysis including pathogen detection and microbiome composition. Recommended
  as a starting point for unexplained GI symptoms.

<h1>Gut Health Comprehensive Panel</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Gut Health Comprehensive Panel combines targeted intestinal inflammation markers with broad microbiome and pathogen analysis to provide a thorough evaluation of gastrointestinal health. This panel is designed as the primary investigative tool for patients presenting with unexplained GI symptoms, chronic digestive complaints, or suspected inflammatory bowel disease, and can guide clinical decisions about the need for endoscopic evaluation.</p>
<p>Fecal calprotectin is a neutrophil-derived protein that is released into the intestinal lumen during mucosal inflammation. It is the single most valuable non-invasive marker for distinguishing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), with high sensitivity and specificity at established cutoff values. Levels correlate with the degree of mucosal inflammation and endoscopic disease activity, making it valuable for both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis treatment response.</p>
<p>The GI-MAP (Gastrointestinal Microbial Assay Plus) is a comprehensive stool analysis that uses quantitative PCR technology to detect and quantify bacterial pathogens, parasites, viral targets, opportunistic organisms, and normal commensal flora. It also includes markers of intestinal health such as secretory IgA (mucosal immune function), anti-gliadin antibodies (gluten sensitivity), pancreatic elastase (exocrine pancreatic function), and steatocrit (fat malabsorption). Reference biomarkers <a href="/garden/dev_admin/labtest/zonulin/" class="internal-link">Zonulin</a> (intestinal permeability) and <a href="/garden/dev_admin/biomarker/calprotectin/" class="internal-link">Calprotectin</a> (mucosal inflammation) provide additional mechanistic information when available through expanded testing.</p>

<h2>Recommended For</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain)</li>
<li>Differentiating IBD (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis) from IBS</li>
<li>Inflammatory bowel disease monitoring and treatment response tracking</li>
<li>Food sensitivity investigation and elimination diet planning</li>
<li>Post-antibiotic assessment of microbiome recovery</li>
<li>Chronic fatigue or autoimmune conditions with suspected gut involvement</li>
<li>Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) evaluation</li>
<li>Pre- and post-probiotic therapy assessment</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clinical Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fecal calprotectin values below 50 mcg/g effectively rule out significant intestinal inflammation and make IBD very unlikely, allowing clinicians to avoid unnecessary colonoscopy in many patients. Values between 50-200 mcg/g represent a borderline zone that may warrant repeat testing or clinical correlation. Values above 200 mcg/g strongly suggest mucosal inflammation and typically warrant endoscopic evaluation. In known IBD patients, calprotectin trends predict relapse (rising levels) or remission (normalizing levels) often weeks before symptom changes occur.</p>
<p>GI-MAP results should be interpreted holistically. Pathogen detection (H. pylori, C. difficile, parasites) requires clinical correlation as some organisms may be commensal at low levels. Low commensal bacteria diversity with overgrowth of opportunistic organisms suggests dysbiosis that may respond to targeted probiotics and dietary interventions. Low secretory IgA indicates compromised mucosal immunity. Low pancreatic elastase (below 200 mcg/g) suggests exocrine pancreatic insufficiency requiring enzyme supplementation. Elevated Zonulin, when available, indicates increased intestinal permeability that may be contributing to systemic inflammation and food sensitivities.</p>
