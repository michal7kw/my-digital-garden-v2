# Coagulation Panel

## Overview
The Coagulation Panel provides a comprehensive assessment of the hemostatic system by evaluating both the intrinsic and extrinsic clotting cascades, fibrinolytic activity, and platelet adequacy. This panel is fundamental for diagnosing bleeding disorders, assessing thrombotic risk, monitoring anticoagulant therapy, and ensuring safe hemostasis prior to surgical procedures.

Prothrombin Time (PT) with INR evaluates the extrinsic pathway (factors VII, X, V, II, and fibrinogen) and is the standard test for monitoring warfarin therapy. Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) assesses the intrinsic pathway (factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II, and fibrinogen) and is used to monitor heparin therapy and screen for factor deficiencies or inhibitors such as lupus anticoagulant. Together, PT and PTT provide a broad overview of clotting cascade integrity.

D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that reflects active clot formation and breakdown, making it highly sensitive for detecting venous thromboembolism (VTE), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and other thrombotic states. Fibrinogen, an acute-phase reactant and essential clotting protein, provides information about both clotting capacity and systemic inflammation. Platelet count ensures adequate platelet numbers for primary hemostasis and helps identify thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis.

## Included Tests

| Test | Biomarker | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| [[prothrombin time pt inr]] | PT/INR | Evaluate extrinsic clotting pathway; monitor warfarin therapy |
| [[partial thromboplastin time ptt]] | PTT/aPTT | Evaluate intrinsic clotting pathway; monitor heparin therapy |
| [[d-dimer]] | D-Dimer | Detect fibrin degradation; screen for VTE and DIC |
| [[fibrinogen]] | Fibrinogen | Assess clotting protein levels and acute-phase inflammation |
| [[platelet count]] | Platelet Count | Quantify platelet numbers for primary hemostasis assessment |

## Recommended For
- Pre-surgical evaluation to ensure adequate hemostasis
- Evaluation of unexplained bleeding or bruising disorders
- Anticoagulant therapy monitoring (warfarin, heparin, DOACs)
- Suspected venous thromboembolism (DVT, pulmonary embolism)
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) workup
- Liver disease assessment (coagulopathy evaluation)

## Clinical Interpretation
The Coagulation Panel should be interpreted as an integrated assessment. An isolated prolonged PT with normal PTT suggests extrinsic pathway deficiency (factor VII) or warfarin effect. An isolated prolonged PTT with normal PT points to intrinsic pathway issues such as factor VIII, IX, XI, or XII deficiency, von Willebrand disease, or lupus anticoagulant. Both PT and PTT prolonged together indicate a common pathway deficiency (factors X, V, II, fibrinogen), DIC, or severe liver disease. Elevated D-dimer with low fibrinogen and low platelets is the classic triad of DIC. An elevated D-dimer alone has high negative predictive value for VTE but low specificity, as it rises with infection, inflammation, malignancy, pregnancy, and recent surgery. Fibrinogen below 100 mg/dL increases bleeding risk, while levels above 400 mg/dL may indicate elevated cardiovascular risk through increased blood viscosity.
