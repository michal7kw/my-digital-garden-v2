# Bone Health Panel

## Overview
The Bone Health Panel is a specialized set of tests designed to evaluate bone metabolism, mineral homeostasis, and the balance between bone formation and resorption. This panel combines direct markers of osteoblast activity with the key minerals and vitamins that regulate skeletal health, providing a comprehensive view of bone turnover dynamics and fracture risk.

Osteocalcin is a bone-specific protein produced by osteoblasts during bone formation and serves as a direct marker of osteoblastic activity and bone turnover rate. Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) is the primary circulating form used to assess vitamin D status, which is critical for intestinal calcium absorption and bone mineralization. Deficiency is strongly associated with osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and increased fracture risk. Serum calcium reflects the tightly regulated calcium balance maintained by parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcitonin, with derangements signaling potential parathyroid disease, malignancy, or renal dysfunction.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme released during bone formation and is elevated in conditions of increased bone turnover such as Paget disease, osteomalacia, healing fractures, and bone metastases. The bone-specific isoform can be measured separately when liver disease may confound total ALP interpretation. Phosphorus works in concert with calcium in hydroxyapatite crystal formation and is regulated by PTH, FGF23, and vitamin D; imbalances directly impact bone mineralization quality.

## Included Tests

| Test | Biomarker | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| [[osteocalcin]] | Osteocalcin | Direct marker of osteoblast activity and bone formation rate |
| [[vitamin d 25oh]] | 25-Hydroxyvitamin D | Assess vitamin D status; critical for calcium absorption |
| [[calcium]] | Serum Calcium | Evaluate calcium homeostasis and parathyroid function |
| [[alkaline phosphatase alp]] | Alkaline Phosphatase | Marker of bone turnover; elevated in metabolic bone diseases |
| [[phosphorus]] | Phosphorus | Assess mineral balance; essential for bone mineralization |

## Recommended For
- Postmenopausal women for osteoporosis risk assessment
- Patients with diagnosed osteoporosis or osteopenia for treatment monitoring
- Fracture risk assessment in elderly populations
- Long-term corticosteroid users (prednisone, dexamethasone)
- Patients with chronic kidney disease (renal osteodystrophy evaluation)
- Individuals with malabsorption syndromes (celiac disease, bariatric surgery)
- Monitoring response to bisphosphonate, denosumab, or teriparatide therapy

## Clinical Interpretation
This panel should be evaluated as an integrated metabolic profile rather than individual markers. Low vitamin D (below 30 ng/mL) with low-normal calcium and elevated ALP suggests osteomalacia or early vitamin D-deficient bone disease. Elevated osteocalcin with elevated ALP indicates high bone turnover, which may be seen in untreated osteoporosis, Paget disease, or hyperparathyroidism. In the context of anti-resorptive therapy (bisphosphonates, denosumab), a declining osteocalcin indicates effective suppression of bone turnover. Hypercalcemia with low phosphorus and elevated ALP points toward primary hyperparathyroidism, while hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia suggests hypoparathyroidism or chronic kidney disease. Normal ALP with low vitamin D and normal calcium may indicate early subclinical deficiency where compensatory PTH elevation is maintaining calcium balance. Serial monitoring every 6-12 months is recommended to track treatment response, with DEXA scan correlation for definitive fracture risk assessment.
