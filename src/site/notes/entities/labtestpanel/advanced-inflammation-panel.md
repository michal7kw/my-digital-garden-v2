# Advanced Inflammation Panel

## Overview
The Advanced Inflammation Panel provides a multi-dimensional assessment of systemic inflammation by combining four core biomarkers that reflect different inflammatory pathways and time courses. Unlike a single inflammatory marker, this panel captures both acute and chronic inflammatory states, vascular inflammation relevant to cardiovascular risk, and the overlap between inflammation and iron metabolism. When cytokine testing is available, Interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha provide additional upstream mechanistic information.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is an acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver in response to IL-6 signaling. At the high-sensitivity assay range, it is the best-validated biomarker for subclinical vascular inflammation and cardiovascular risk stratification, with levels above 3.0 mg/L indicating high cardiovascular risk per AHA/CDC guidelines. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) reflects plasma protein changes (particularly fibrinogen and immunoglobulins) that promote red blood cell aggregation, making it a reliable indicator of chronic inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disease activity, and occult infection.

Fibrinogen serves a dual role as both a clotting factor and an acute-phase reactant. Elevated fibrinogen increases blood viscosity and promotes thrombus formation, making it an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Ferritin, while primarily an iron storage protein, is also a potent acute-phase reactant that can rise dramatically during infection, inflammation, and tissue damage; markedly elevated ferritin is a hallmark of macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. When available, [[Interleukin 6]] and [[TNF Alpha]] provide direct measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive the acute-phase response.

## Included Tests

| Test | Biomarker | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| [[high sensitivity c reactive protein hs crp]] | hs-CRP | Vascular inflammation; cardiovascular risk stratification |
| [[esr]] | ESR | Chronic inflammation; autoimmune disease activity |
| [[fibrinogen]] | Fibrinogen | Acute-phase reactant; thrombotic and cardiovascular risk |
| [[ferritin]] | Ferritin | Iron stores and acute-phase reactant; tissue inflammation |
| [[Interleukin 6]] | IL-6 (if available) | Pro-inflammatory cytokine; upstream driver of CRP |
| [[TNF Alpha]] | TNF-alpha (if available) | Pro-inflammatory cytokine; systemic inflammation mediator |

## Recommended For
- Cardiovascular risk assessment and metabolic syndrome evaluation
- Autoimmune disease monitoring (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, vasculitis)
- Chronic inflammation evaluation in persistent fatigue or pain
- Post-infection recovery monitoring (post-COVID, post-sepsis)
- Cancer-related inflammation assessment
- Monitoring response to anti-inflammatory therapies

## Clinical Interpretation
The four core markers provide complementary information that should be assessed together. Elevated hs-CRP with normal ESR suggests acute vascular inflammation or metabolic syndrome, while elevated ESR with normal hs-CRP may indicate chronic low-grade inflammation from autoimmune disease or paraproteinemia. Both elevated together strongly suggest active systemic inflammation requiring investigation. Fibrinogen above 400 mg/dL independently increases cardiovascular risk through increased viscosity and platelet aggregation, and when elevated alongside hs-CRP, indicates particularly high vascular risk. Ferritin must be interpreted cautiously: levels above 300 ng/mL in men or 200 ng/mL in women may reflect iron overload (hemochromatosis) or active inflammation. When ferritin is elevated with elevated CRP and ESR, the inflammatory contribution predominates; iron studies (transferrin saturation, TIBC) help distinguish the two causes. IL-6 and TNF-alpha, when available, provide mechanistic information about upstream inflammatory drivers and can guide targeted anti-cytokine therapy decisions. Serial monitoring every 3-6 months allows tracking of inflammatory burden and treatment response.
