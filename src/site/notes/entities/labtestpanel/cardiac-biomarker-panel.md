# Cardiac Biomarker Panel

## Overview
The Cardiac Biomarker Panel is a specialized set of blood tests designed to evaluate myocardial injury, cardiac stress, and heart failure. It combines cardiac troponins, which are the gold-standard markers for detecting myocardial necrosis, with natriuretic peptides that reflect ventricular wall stress and volume overload. Together, these biomarkers provide a comprehensive assessment of both acute cardiac damage and chronic heart failure status.

This panel is most commonly ordered in the emergency department setting for patients presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, or suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Troponin I and high-sensitivity troponin T are highly specific to cardiac muscle and rise within hours of myocardial injury, making them indispensable for ruling in or ruling out acute myocardial infarction. Serial measurements over 3-6 hours significantly improve diagnostic accuracy.

BNP and NT-proBNP are released by cardiomyocytes in response to increased wall stretch and pressure overload. Elevated levels correlate with the severity of heart failure and are used both for initial diagnosis and ongoing monitoring of treatment response. Creatine kinase (CK), while less specific than troponins, provides supplementary information about the extent of muscle damage and can help differentiate cardiac from skeletal muscle injury when CK-MB isoforms are assessed.

## Included Tests

| Test | Biomarker | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| [[troponin i]] | Troponin I | Detect myocardial necrosis; highly specific cardiac injury marker |
| [[troponin t high sensitivity]] | hs-Troponin T | Early detection of myocardial injury with enhanced sensitivity |
| [[bnp]] | B-type Natriuretic Peptide | Assess ventricular wall stress and heart failure severity |
| [[nt probnp]] | NT-proBNP | Evaluate heart failure status; longer half-life than BNP |
| [[Creatine Kinase]] | Creatine Kinase (CK) | Assess extent of muscle damage; supplementary cardiac marker |

## Recommended For
- Emergency chest pain evaluation and acute coronary syndrome workup
- Heart failure diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring
- Post-myocardial infarction follow-up and prognostication
- Perioperative cardiac risk assessment in high-risk surgical patients
- Monitoring cardiotoxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy

## Clinical Interpretation
Interpreting the Cardiac Biomarker Panel requires evaluating all markers in concert. Elevated troponins with a characteristic rise-and-fall pattern strongly suggest acute myocardial infarction, while chronically mildly elevated troponins may indicate heart failure, renal insufficiency, or chronic myocardial strain. BNP values above 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP above 300 pg/mL support a diagnosis of heart failure, with higher values indicating more severe disease. When troponins are elevated but natriuretic peptides are normal, consider non-heart-failure causes of myocardial injury such as myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, or demand ischemia. Creatine kinase elevations without troponin elevation suggest skeletal muscle rather than cardiac injury. Age, renal function, and BMI must be considered when interpreting natriuretic peptide levels, as these factors significantly affect reference ranges.
