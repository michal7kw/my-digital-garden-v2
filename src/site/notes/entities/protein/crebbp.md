# CREBBP

## Overview
**CREB-binding protein (CREBBP/CBP)** is a ubiquitous and essential transcriptional coactivator. It works closely with its paralog **p300** (EP300).

Its primary function is **Histone Acetylation (HAT activity)**: adding acetyl groups to lysine residues on histone tails. This neutralizes the positive charge of histones, loosening their grip on DNA and allowing transcription factors to bind.

It interacts with hundreds of proteins, serving as a central node in transcriptional regulation networks.
