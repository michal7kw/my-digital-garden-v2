# AR

## Overview
The **Androgen Receptor (AR)** is a critical transcription factor. In the absence of ligand, it resides in the cytoplasm bound to heat shock proteins (HSP90). Upon binding **Testosterone** or **Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)**, it undergoes a conformational change, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus.

In the nucleus, it binds to Androgen Response Elements (AREs) in the promoters of target genes (e.g., PSA/KLK3), driving cell growth and survival.

## Clinical Significance
- **Prostate Cancer**: AR signaling is the primary driver. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) works by starving this receptor of ligand. Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) often involves AR amplification or mutations.
- **Kennedy's Disease**: Caused by CAG repeat expansion in the AR gene.
