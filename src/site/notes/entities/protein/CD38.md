# CD38

## Overview

CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as the major NAD+ consuming enzyme in mammalian tissues. Originally identified as a lymphocyte differentiation antigen, CD38 has emerged as a critical regulator of NAD+ homeostasis and a key contributor to age-related NAD+ decline.

CD38's NAD+ consuming activity has profound implications for aging and metabolic health. Studies show that CD38 expression and activity increase with age and inflammation, driving down NAD+ levels and consequently reducing sirtuin activity. Inhibiting CD38 has become a promising strategy for restoring youthful NAD+ levels.

Beyond NAD+ metabolism, CD38 plays important roles in immune cell signaling, calcium mobilization, and has emerged as a therapeutic target in multiple myeloma treatment.

## Mechanism of Action

### Enzymatic Activities

CD38 has multiple enzymatic activities:

1. **NAD+ Glycohydrolase**: NAD+ → Nicotinamide + ADP-ribose (primary activity)
2. **ADP-ribosyl Cyclase**: NAD+ → Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)
3. **cADPR Hydrolase**: cADPR → ADP-ribose

### NAD+ Consumption

- **High Catalytic Rate**: ~100 NAD+ molecules/second
- **Major NAD+ Consumer**: Accounts for majority of cellular NAD+ degradation
- **Age-Dependent Increase**: Expression rises with age and inflammation
- **Senescence-Associated**: Increased in senescent cells (SASP component)

### Calcium Signaling

- cADPR production mobilizes calcium from ER stores
- Important for immune cell activation
- Regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells

## Role in Aging

### Age-Related NAD+ Decline

- CD38 expression increases 2-3 fold with age in multiple tissues
- Contributes to ~50% reduction in NAD+ levels seen in aged tissues
- Driven by chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging)
- CD38 knockout mice maintain youthful NAD+ levels

### Senescent Cell Involvement

- Senescent cells express high CD38
- Part of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
- Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) upregulate CD38
- Creates vicious cycle of inflammation → CD38 → low NAD+ → dysfunction

## Clinical Significance

### Therapeutic Targeting

**CD38 Inhibitors for NAD+ Restoration**:
- Apigenin (natural flavonoid)
- Quercetin (natural flavonoid)
- 78c (synthetic inhibitor)
- Luteolinidin

**Anti-CD38 Antibodies (Cancer)**:
- Daratumumab (multiple myeloma)
- Isatuximab (multiple myeloma)

### Disease Associations

- **Multiple Myeloma**: CD38 overexpressed, therapeutic target
- **Metabolic Syndrome**: CD38-driven NAD+ decline contributes
- **Neurodegeneration**: CD38 inhibition protective in models
- **Cardiac Aging**: CD38 contributes to age-related cardiac dysfunction
