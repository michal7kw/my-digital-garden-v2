# BACE1

## Overview
**BACE1 (Beta-site APP Cleaving Enzyme 1)** is an aspartyl protease. It performs the first cut of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), creating the C99 fragment. This is the **rate-limiting step** in the generation of the toxic Amyloid Beta peptide.

Because of this, BACE1 inhibition has been a major target for Alzheimer's drugs, though clinical trials have struggled with side effects (due to BACE1's role in myelin maintenance via Neuregulin-1 cleavage).
