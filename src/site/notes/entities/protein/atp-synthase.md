# ATP Synthase

## Overview

ATP synthase (Complex V) is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing the majority of cellular ATP. It is a remarkable molecular machine that uses the proton gradient generated by the electron transport chain to drive the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.

The enzyme consists of two main portions:
- **F1** (catalytic): Mushroom-shaped head in the matrix
- **Fo** (proton channel): Membrane-embedded base

ATP synthase represents one of the smallest rotary motors in nature, spinning at up to 9,000 rpm and producing approximately 100 ATP molecules per second.

## Structure

### Fo Portion (Membrane)
- **a subunit**: Contains proton half-channels
- **c-ring**: 8-15 c subunits forming a rotating ring
- **b subunit**: Part of peripheral stalk
- Function: Converts proton flow to rotation

### F1 Portion (Matrix)
- **α3β3 hexamer**: Alternating α and β subunits
- **β subunits**: Contain catalytic sites
- **γ subunit**: Central rotating shaft
- **δ/ε subunits**: Coupling between Fo and F1
- **OSCP**: Part of peripheral stalk

### Peripheral Stalk
- Connects Fo and F1 non-rotationally
- Prevents co-rotation of α3β3 with γ
- Essential for coupling

## Rotary Catalysis

### Proton-Driven Rotation
1. Protons enter from intermembrane space via a subunit half-channel
2. Protons bind to c subunit carboxyl groups
3. c-ring rotates as protons are released to matrix
4. Rotation transmitted to γ subunit

### Binding Change Mechanism (Paul Boyer)
The three β subunits cycle through three conformational states:
1. **Open (O)**: Low substrate affinity, releases ATP
2. **Loose (L)**: Binds ADP + Pi loosely
3. **Tight (T)**: Substrates bound tightly, catalysis occurs

**120° rotation converts each site to next state**

### ATP Synthesis
- Each 360° rotation: 3 ATP synthesized
- H⁺/ATP ratio: ~3-4 protons per ATP
- Efficiency: ~40% (comparable to combustion engines)

## Energetics

### Proton Motive Force
- ΔG for ATP synthesis: +30.5 kJ/mol
- Requires ~3-4 protons (10-13 kJ/mol each)
- Proton gradient provides driving force

### Reversibility
- ATP synthase can run in reverse
- Hydrolyzes ATP to pump protons
- Occurs during ischemia (wastes ATP)
- IF1 protein inhibits reverse mode

## Regulation

### Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1)
- Prevents ATP hydrolysis during hypoxia
- Active at low pH (ischemia)
- Protects ATP stores

### Ca²⁺ Regulation
- Ca²⁺ enhances ATP synthase activity
- Coordinates with TCA cycle activation
- Important in muscle and neurons

### Membrane Potential
- Activity depends on proton motive force
- Uncouplers dissipate gradient, stop synthesis
- Critical for metabolic flexibility

## Inhibitors

| Inhibitor | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Oligomycin | Blocks proton channel in Fo |
| DCCD | Covalently modifies c subunit |
| Aurovertin | Binds β subunit |
| Efrapeptin | Binds F1 |

## Clinical Significance

### Mitochondrial Diseases
- ATP synthase deficiency (rare but severe)
- ATP6 mutations (mtDNA-encoded)
- Neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa (NARP)
- Leigh syndrome

### Ischemia-Reperfusion
- Reverse mode wastes ATP during ischemia
- IF1 provides some protection
- Therapeutic target for cardioprotection

### Cancer
- Altered ATP synthase in some cancers
- IF1 overexpression in some tumors
- Metabolic adaptation to hypoxia

### Aging
- ATP synthase activity declines with age
- Contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction
- Assembly defects accumulate
