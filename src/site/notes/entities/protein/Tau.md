# Tau

## Overview
**Tau** is a neuronal protein that normally binds to and stabilizes microtubules, the "tracks" for axonal transport.

In Alzheimer's Disease, Tau becomes **hyperphosphorylated** by kinases (like GSK3-beta and CDK5). This causes it to detach from microtubules (leading to cytoskeletal collapse) and aggregate into insoluble paired helical filaments, forming **Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs)**. The spread of Tau pathology correlates strongly with cognitive decline.
