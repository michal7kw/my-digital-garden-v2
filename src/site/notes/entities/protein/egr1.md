# EGR1

## Overview
**EGR1 (Early Growth Response 1)** acts as a nuclear gateway, translating extracellular signals into long-term changes in gene expression.

In the brain, EGR1 expression is a marker of neuronal activity. During learning tasks, EGR1 is upregulated in the hippocampus and is required for the stabilization of memories (consolidation).
