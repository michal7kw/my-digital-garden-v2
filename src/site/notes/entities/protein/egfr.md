# EGFR

## Overview
**Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)**, also known as ErbB1 or HER1, is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Upon binding by ligands such as EGF or TGF-alpha, it dimerizes and autophosphorylates, triggering downstream signaling pathways that promote cell growth and division.

Overexpression or mutational activation of EGFR drives many cancers, making it a critical therapeutic target. Inhibitors include small molecule **Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)** like Gefitinib and Erlotinib, and **Monoclonal Antibodies** like Cetuximab.

## Signaling Pathways
1.  **RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK**: Cell proliferation.
2.  **PI3K-AKT-mTOR**: Cell survival and anti-apoptosis.
3.  **JAK-STAT**: Cell division and immune regulation.
