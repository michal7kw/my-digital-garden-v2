# ApoE

## Overview
**Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)** is the primary cholesterol carrier in the brain. It is produced mainly by astrocytes.

The **ApoE4** isoform differs from the common ApoE3 by a single amino acid change (Cys112Arg), which alters its structure. This structural change:
1.  Reduces its ability to bind and clear Amyloid Beta plaques.
2.  Increases neuroinflammation.
3.  Impairs blood-brain barrier integrity.
