# APP

## Overview
**Amyloid-beta Precursor Protein (APP)** is an integral membrane protein expressed in many tissues and concentrated in the synapses of neurons. Its primary function is not fully understood, but it has been implicated as a regulator of synapse formation, neural plasticity, and iron export.

APP is best known as the precursor molecule whose proteolysis generates **Amyloid Beta (Aβ)**, a polypeptide containing 37 to 49 amino acid residues, whose amyloid fibrillar form is the primary component of **amyloid plaques** found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients.

## Processing Pathways
APP can be processed by two pathways:
1.  **Non-amyloidogenic pathway**: Cleavage by α-secretase (prevents Aβ formation).
2.  **Amyloidogenic pathway**: Cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) followed by γ-secretase, releasing Aβ peptides (Aβ40, Aβ42).
