# CTCF

## Overview
**CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor)** is a highly conserved zinc finger protein. It is unique in its ability to function as a versatile regulatory hub.

- **Insulation**: By binding between an enhancer and a promoter, it blocks their interaction, preventing inappropriate gene activation.
- **Chromatin Looping**: It works with the **Cohesin** complex to extrude chromatin loops, organizing the genome into distinct functional domains (TADs).
