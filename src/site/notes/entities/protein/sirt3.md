# SIRT3

## Overview

SIRT3 (Sirtuin 3) is the major mitochondrial deacetylase and a key regulator of mitochondrial function. Located exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix, SIRT3 controls the activity of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and antioxidant defense.

SIRT3 plays a central role in the metabolic adaptation to nutrient stress. During fasting, exercise, or caloric restriction, SIRT3 expression and activity increase, optimizing mitochondrial metabolism for efficient energy production while minimizing oxidative damage.

SIRT3 has emerged as a crucial protein for healthy aging, with studies showing that SIRT3 levels decline with age while its absence accelerates age-related metabolic dysfunction. Maintaining SIRT3 activity through lifestyle interventions may be important for preserving mitochondrial health throughout life.

## Mechanism of Action

### Enzymatic Activity

Like other sirtuins, SIRT3 requires NAD+ as a cofactor:
- **Reaction**: Acetyl-lysine + NAD+ → Lysine + Nicotinamide + O-acetyl-ADP-ribose
- **Location**: Exclusively mitochondrial matrix
- **Regulation**: Activity increases with elevated mitochondrial NAD+

### Key Mitochondrial Substrates

1. **Complex I (NDUFA9)**: Electron transport chain
2. **Complex II (SDHA)**: Succinate dehydrogenase
3. **Complex III (OSCP)**: ATP synthase
4. **SOD2**: Manganese superoxide dismutase (antioxidant)
5. **LCAD**: Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (fatty acid oxidation)
6. **IDH2**: Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2
7. **GDH**: Glutamate dehydrogenase
8. **Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2**: Fatty acid metabolism

## Biological Functions

### Metabolic Regulation

- **Fatty Acid Oxidation**: Activates LCAD and other beta-oxidation enzymes
- **Krebs Cycle**: Regulates multiple TCA cycle enzymes
- **Oxidative Phosphorylation**: Optimizes ETC efficiency
- **Ketogenesis**: Supports ketone body production during fasting

### Antioxidant Defense

- **SOD2 Activation**: Deacetylation activates manganese superoxide dismutase
- **ROS Reduction**: Minimizes electron leak from ETC
- **IDH2**: Supports NADPH regeneration for glutathione recycling

### Mitochondrial Quality Control

- **Mitochondrial Biogenesis**: Works with PGC-1α network
- **Mitophagy Regulation**: Influences damaged mitochondria clearance
- **mtDNA Maintenance**: Supports mitochondrial genome integrity

## Clinical Significance

### Disease Associations

- **Metabolic Syndrome**: SIRT3 deficiency promotes metabolic dysfunction
- **Cardiac Disease**: Protective against cardiac hypertrophy and failure
- **Cancer**: Complex role; generally tumor suppressive
- **Hearing Loss**: Age-related hearing loss linked to SIRT3 decline
- **Neurodegeneration**: Neuroprotective in multiple models

### Aging

- SIRT3 levels decline with age
- SIRT3 polymorphisms associated with longevity
- CR and exercise maintain SIRT3 expression
- SIRT3 knockout mice show accelerated aging phenotypes
