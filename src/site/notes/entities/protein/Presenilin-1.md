# Presenilin-1

## Overview
**Presenilin-1 (PS1)** is the active enzymatic component of the **Gamma-Secretase** complex (which also includes Nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2).

It performs the final intramembrane cleavage of APP, releasing the Amyloid Beta peptide into the extracellular space. Mutations in PS1 alter the precision of this cut, favoring the production of the longer, "stickier" **Aβ42** isoform over the more benign Aβ40.
