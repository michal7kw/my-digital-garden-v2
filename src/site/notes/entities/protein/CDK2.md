# CDK2

## Overview
**Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2)** is a core component of the cell cycle machinery. It is inactive as a monomer and requires binding to Cyclins to form an active kinase complex.

1.  **G1/S Transition**: Binds **Cyclin E**. Phosphorylates Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), releasing E2F transcription factors to drive DNA synthesis genes.
2.  **S Phase**: Binds **Cyclin A**. Required for DNA replication progression.
