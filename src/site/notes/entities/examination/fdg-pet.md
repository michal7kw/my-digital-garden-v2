# FDG-PET (Fluorodeoxyglucose PET)

## Overview
FDG-PET measures regional cerebral glucose metabolism, which reflects synaptic activity and neuronal function. In neurodegenerative diseases, characteristic patterns of hypometabolism precede structural atrophy and help differentiate between dementia subtypes. FDG-PET represents the "N" (neurodegeneration) component in the ATN biomarker framework.

## Mechanism

### Tracer Behavior
- 18F-FDG is a glucose analog
- Taken up by metabolically active cells
- Phosphorylated by hexokinase → trapped in cells
- Signal reflects regional glucose utilization
- Half-life: 110 minutes

### Brain Metabolism
- Brain uses ~20% of body's glucose
- Glucose metabolism correlates with synaptic activity
- Hypometabolism indicates dysfunction or neurodegeneration

## Disease-Specific Patterns

### Alzheimer's Disease
- **Classic pattern**: Posterior cingulate, precuneus, temporoparietal
- **Progression**: Bilateral, spreading to frontal
- **Spared**: Sensorimotor cortex, visual cortex, basal ganglia
- **"AD signature"**: Highly characteristic

### Frontotemporal Dementia
- **bvFTD**: Frontal and anterior temporal hypometabolism
- **svPPA**: Left anterior temporal predominant
- **nfvPPA**: Left frontal operculum, insula
- Asymmetry common

### Dementia with Lewy Bodies
- **Occipital hypometabolism**: Distinguishes from AD
- "Cingulate island sign": Preserved posterior cingulate
- Visual cortex involvement (visual hallucinations)

### Parkinson's Disease Dementia
- Similar to DLB
- Occipital involvement
- May overlap with AD pattern in mixed cases

### Vascular Dementia
- Multifocal, patchy hypometabolism
- Corresponds to infarct locations
- Less characteristic pattern

### Corticobasal Syndrome
- Asymmetric frontoparietal hypometabolism
- Contralateral to symptomatic side
- Basal ganglia may show changes

### Progressive Supranuclear Palsy
- Frontal, especially medial frontal
- Midbrain hypometabolism
- "Striatal pattern" in some cases

## Quantitative Analysis

### Visual Assessment
- Side-by-side comparison with normal database
- Pattern recognition by trained readers
- Sensitivity ~90%, specificity ~85%

### Statistical Parametric Mapping
- Voxel-based comparison to normal controls
- Z-score maps highlight abnormalities
- NeuroQ, Cortex ID, Syngo.via

### SUVR Quantification
- Regional standardized uptake value ratios
- Pons or whole brain reference
- Longitudinal comparison

## Clinical Applications

### Dementia Differential Diagnosis
1. AD vs FTD (different patterns)
2. DLB vs AD (occipital involvement)
3. Atypical presentations
4. Young-onset dementia

### Prognosis
- Severity of hypometabolism predicts decline
- Rate of metabolic change tracks progression
- Worse metabolism = faster decline

### Treatment Monitoring
- Research: Tracking drug effects
- May detect improvement or stabilization

## ATN Framework Role

### "N" Component
- Neurodegeneration marker
- Alternatives: MRI volumetry, CSF t-tau
- Functional change may precede structural

### Combined Interpretation
- A+T+N+: Full AD pathology
- A-T-N+: Suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP)
- Metabolic patterns refine diagnosis

## Relationships

### Conditions
- → [[Alzheimer's Disease]] (condition) - *Temporoparietal pattern*
- → [[Frontotemporal Dementia]] (condition) - *Frontal pattern*
- → [[Lewy Body Dementia]] (condition) - *Occipital involvement*
- → [[Vascular Dementia]] (condition) - *Patchy, multifocal*
- → [[Mild Cognitive Impairment]] (condition) - *Predicts conversion*

### Related Imaging
- → [[Amyloid PET Imaging]] (examination) - *ATN A component*
- → [[Tau PET Imaging]] (examination) - *ATN T component*
- → [[MRI Volumetry]] (examination) - *Structural correlate*

### Brain Regions
- → [[Posterior Cingulate Cortex]] (organ) - *Early AD involvement*
- → [[Precuneus]] (organ) - *AD signature region*
- → [[Prefrontal Cortex]] (organ) - *FTD involvement*

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- Well-established technique
- Widely available (oncology infrastructure)
- Excellent differential diagnosis
- Medicare coverage for dementia

### Limitations
- Radiation exposure (~7 mSv)
- Cost (~$2,500-4,000)
- Non-specific (reflects any cause of hypometabolism)
- Affected by blood glucose levels
- Requires fasting and quiet environment

## Practical Considerations

### Patient Preparation
- 4-6 hour fast (water allowed)
- Blood glucose <200 mg/dL (ideally <150)
- Quiet, dimly lit environment during uptake
- Avoid stimulation during 30-45 min uptake period

### Image Acquisition
- Scan starts ~30-45 min post-injection
- 10-20 minute acquisition
- CT for attenuation correction
