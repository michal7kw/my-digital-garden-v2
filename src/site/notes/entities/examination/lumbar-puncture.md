# Lumbar Puncture

## Overview
Lumbar puncture (LP), also known as spinal tap, is a procedure to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid space. In the context of neurodegeneration, CSF analysis provides direct measurement of brain-derived biomarkers that reflect Alzheimer's pathology (Aβ42, p-tau, t-tau) and neurodegeneration (NfL, GFAP). CSF biomarkers are a cost-effective alternative to amyloid and tau PET imaging.

## Procedure

### Technique
1. **Position**: Lateral decubitus (fetal) or sitting
2. **Landmark**: L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace (below conus medullaris)
3. **Needle**: 20-22 gauge atraumatic needle (Sprotte, Whitacre)
4. **Collection**: Opening pressure, then sequential tubes

### Sample Collection for Biomarkers
| Tube | Volume | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 1-2 mL | Cell count, protein, glucose |
| 2 | 1-2 mL | Microbiology (if indicated) |
| 3-4 | 10-15 mL | AD biomarkers (polypropylene tubes!) |

### Critical Pre-analytical Factors
- **Tube material**: Polypropylene (Aβ42 adsorbs to polystyrene)
- **Processing time**: Process within 1-2 hours or freeze
- **Centrifugation**: 2000g x 10 min at 4°C
- **Storage**: -80°C for long-term
- **Freeze-thaw cycles**: Minimize (affects some analytes)

## CSF Biomarkers for Neurodegeneration

### Core AD Biomarkers (ATN)
| Biomarker | Reflects | Typical Cutoff | Change in AD |
|-----------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Aβ42 | Amyloid pathology | <500 pg/mL | Decreased |
| Aβ42/Aβ40 | Amyloid (ratio) | <0.089 | Decreased |
| p-tau181 | Tau pathology | >60 pg/mL | Increased |
| p-tau217 | Tau pathology | Assay-specific | Increased |
| t-tau | Neurodegeneration | >400 pg/mL | Increased |

### Additional Biomarkers
| Biomarker | Reflects | Clinical Utility |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| NfL | Axonal damage | Pan-neurodegeneration; prognosis |
| GFAP | Astrocyte activation | Neuroinflammation |
| Neurogranin | Synaptic dysfunction | Synaptic biomarker |
| sTREM2 | Microglial activation | Neuroinflammation |
| YKL-40 | Inflammation | Glial marker |
| α-synuclein | Synucleinopathy | PD/DLB research |

## Clinical Applications

### Dementia Diagnosis
- Differentiate AD from non-AD dementias
- Confirm AD pathology in atypical presentations
- Support clinical diagnosis in uncertain cases

### ATN Classification
- **A+**: Low Aβ42 or Aβ42/40 ratio
- **T+**: Elevated p-tau
- **N+**: Elevated t-tau or NfL

### Anti-Amyloid Therapy Eligibility
- CSF Aβ42/40 ratio as alternative to amyloid PET
- More accessible and less expensive
- ~90% concordance with PET

### Research Applications
- Longitudinal biomarker tracking
- Clinical trial inclusion/outcome
- Novel biomarker discovery

## Contraindications and Risks

### Absolute Contraindications
- Skin infection at puncture site
- Significantly raised intracranial pressure with mass effect
- Severe coagulopathy (uncontrolled)

### Relative Contraindications
- Anticoagulation (may need to hold)
- Thrombocytopenia (<50,000)
- Spinal abnormalities

### Complications
| Complication | Incidence | Prevention/Management |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Post-LP headache | 5-30% | Atraumatic needle, hydration |
| Back pain | 10-20% | Proper technique |
| Bleeding | Rare | Correct coagulopathy |
| Infection | Very rare | Sterile technique |
| Nerve root irritation | Rare | Proper needle placement |

### Reducing Post-LP Headache
- Use atraumatic (pencil-point) needles
- Smaller gauge (22G vs 20G)
- Replace stylet before withdrawal
- Lie flat post-procedure (debated)
- Hydration encouraged

## Comparison: CSF vs Plasma Biomarkers

| Feature | CSF | Plasma |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Invasiveness | Lumbar puncture | Blood draw |
| Brain proximity | Direct | Indirect |
| Sensitivity | Higher | Lower |
| Aβ42/40 | Well-established | Emerging |
| p-tau | Well-established | Validated (p-tau217) |
| Availability | Specialty centers | Broader |
| Cost | Moderate (~$500-800) | Lower (~$200-400) |

## Relationships

### Biomarkers Measured
- → [[Amyloid-Beta 42/40 Ratio]] (biomarker) - *CSF gold standard*
- → [[Phospho-Tau]] (biomarker) - *Tau pathology*
- → [[Total Tau]] (biomarker) - *Neurodegeneration*
- → [[Neurofilament Light Chain]] (biomarker) - *Axonal damage*
- → [[GFAP]] (biomarker) - *Astrocyte marker*

### Conditions
- → [[Alzheimer's Disease]] (condition) - *Core diagnostic*
- → [[Mild Cognitive Impairment]] (condition) - *Risk stratification*
- → [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease]] (condition) - *RT-QuIC, 14-3-3*
- → [[Multiple Sclerosis]] (condition) - *Oligoclonal bands*
- → [[Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus]] (condition) - *Therapeutic tap*

### Related Examinations
- ← [[Amyloid PET Imaging]] (examination) - *Alternative for A+*
- ← [[Tau PET Imaging]] (examination) - *Alternative for T+*

## Practical Workflow

### Pre-Procedure
1. Review indications and contraindications
2. Check coagulation if on anticoagulants
3. Consent (explain risks, benefits)
4. Prepare polypropylene tubes in advance

### Procedure Day
1. Position patient comfortably
2. Sterile prep and drape
3. Local anesthesia
4. Atraumatic needle insertion
5. Measure opening pressure (if indicated)
6. Collect 10-15 mL in sequential tubes
7. Remove needle with stylet in place

### Post-Procedure
1. Patient lies flat 30-60 min (optional)
2. Encourage oral hydration
3. Monitor for headache
4. Process samples per protocol
