# EEG (Electroencephalography)

## Overview
Electroencephalography (EEG) records the brain's electrical activity through scalp electrodes. While primarily used for epilepsy diagnosis, EEG provides valuable information in neurodegenerative diseases, including characteristic patterns in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), assessment of delirium/encephalopathy, and prognostication after cardiac arrest. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) is increasingly used in dementia research.

## Technical Aspects

### Standard Recording
- **Electrodes**: 21-channel (10-20 system) or higher density
- **Duration**: 20-60 minutes routine; longer for sleep/activation
- **Activations**: Hyperventilation, photic stimulation, sleep

### Quantitative EEG (qEEG)
- Computer-analyzed spectral power
- Frequency band analysis (delta, theta, alpha, beta)
- Coherence and connectivity measures
- Research tool for dementia

## EEG Findings in Neurodegeneration

### Alzheimer's Disease
- **Slowing**: Decreased alpha, increased theta/delta
- **Alpha rhythm**: Reduced frequency (slowed posterior dominant rhythm)
- **Reduced complexity**: Lower entropy on qEEG
- **Correlates** with cognitive impairment severity

### Lewy Body Dementia
- More pronounced slowing than AD
- **Fluctuations** visible on serial recordings
- Transient sharp waves (posterior)
- May help differentiate from AD

### Frontotemporal Dementia
- Often **normal EEG** in early stages
- Frontal slowing may develop
- Less pronounced than AD

### Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
- **Periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs)**
- 1-2 Hz, often triphasic
- Highly specific (but late finding)
- Sensitivity ~65%, specificity ~90%
- May be absent in variant CJD

### Hepatic/Metabolic Encephalopathy
- **Triphasic waves** (anterior predominant)
- Diffuse slowing
- Helps differentiate from CJD

## Clinical Applications

### Dementia Workup
- Exclude seizures as cause of cognitive symptoms
- CJD screening (PSWCs)
- Differentiate delirium from dementia
- DLB vs AD (degree of slowing)

### Seizure Detection
- Non-convulsive status epilepticus in dementia
- Transient epileptic amnesia
- Post-ictal confusion

### Prognostication After Cardiac Arrest
- Part of multimodal assessment
- Malignant patterns (suppression-burst, unreactive)
- Predicts poor neurological outcome
- Combined with NSE, SSEPs, imaging

### Delirium vs Dementia
- Delirium: More pronounced slowing, triphasic waves
- Dementia: Baseline slowing, less dramatic
- Serial EEGs helpful for fluctuating states

## Advanced EEG Techniques

### Quantitative EEG (qEEG) in Dementia Research
| Measure | AD Finding | Utility |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Alpha power | Decreased | Correlates with cognition |
| Theta/alpha ratio | Increased | Severity marker |
| Coherence | Reduced | Disconnection |
| Spectral entropy | Decreased | Complexity loss |

### Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)
- **P300**: Prolonged latency in AD
- **MMN (Mismatch negativity)**: Auditory processing
- Research biomarker for early detection

### High-Density EEG
- 64-256 channels
- Better spatial resolution
- Source localization
- Research applications

## Relationships

### Conditions
- → [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease]] (condition) - *PSWCs diagnostic*
- → [[Alzheimer's Disease]] (condition) - *Diffuse slowing*
- → [[Lewy Body Dementia]] (condition) - *Marked slowing*
- → [[Epilepsy]] (condition) - *Primary indication*
- → [[Delirium]] (condition) - *Triphasic waves, slowing*

### Related Examinations
- ← [[Neuropsychological Testing]] (examination) - *Cognitive correlate*
- ← [[MRI Volumetry]] (examination) - *Structural correlate*
- → [[Evoked Potentials]] (examination) - *Related technique*

### Biomarkers
- → [[NSE]] (biomarker) - *Combined in cardiac arrest prognosis*
- → [[Neurofilament Light Chain]] (biomarker) - *Neurodegeneration*

## Interpretation Guide

### Normal Findings
- Posterior dominant rhythm 8-13 Hz (alpha)
- Symmetric, reactive to eye opening
- Beta activity anteriorly
- Appropriate sleep architecture if recorded

### Abnormal Patterns
| Pattern | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Generalized slowing | Encephalopathy, dementia |
| Focal slowing | Structural lesion |
| Epileptiform discharges | Epilepsy risk |
| Triphasic waves | Metabolic encephalopathy |
| PSWCs | CJD |
| Suppression-burst | Severe encephalopathy |

### Caveats
- Medications affect EEG (benzodiazepines, antiepileptics)
- Age-related slowing is normal (mild)
- Single EEG has limited sensitivity for seizures
- Normal EEG doesn't exclude pathology

## Practical Considerations

### Indications for EEG in Dementia
1. Rapidly progressive dementia (CJD concern)
2. Fluctuating consciousness (DLB, delirium)
3. Episodic symptoms (seizures, TIA)
4. Encephalopathy assessment
5. Post-cardiac arrest prognosis

### Not Routinely Indicated
- Typical, slowly progressive AD
- Routine MCI evaluation
- Screening without specific indication
