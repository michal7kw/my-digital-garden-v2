# EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies

## Overview
Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) are electrodiagnostic techniques that assess the function of peripheral nerves and muscles. In neurodegenerative disease, particularly ALS, EMG/NCS is essential for confirming lower motor neuron involvement, assessing disease extent, and excluding mimicking conditions. The combination of clinical upper motor neuron signs and EMG-confirmed lower motor neuron involvement is diagnostic for ALS.

## Components

### Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)

#### Motor NCS
- Stimulate nerve, record from muscle
- Measures: Amplitude (axon number), velocity (myelin), latency
- Normal motor velocities: >50 m/s (arms), >40 m/s (legs)

#### Sensory NCS
- Stimulate and record from same nerve
- **Critical in ALS**: Sensory responses are NORMAL
- Abnormal sensory = not pure motor neuron disease

#### F-waves and H-reflexes
- Assess proximal nerve segments
- F-wave: Motor neuron excitability
- H-reflex: Sensory-motor loop (S1)

### Needle EMG

#### Spontaneous Activity
| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Fibrillation potentials | Active denervation |
| Positive sharp waves | Active denervation |
| Fasciculation potentials | LMN irritability (ALS hallmark) |
| Complex repetitive discharges | Chronic denervation |
| Myotonic discharges | Myotonic disorders |

#### Motor Unit Analysis
| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Large, polyphasic MUAPs | Chronic reinnervation |
| Reduced recruitment | Neurogenic process |
| Early recruitment | Myopathic process |
| Unstable MUAPs | Active reinnervation |

## ALS Electrodiagnosis

### El Escorial/Awaji Criteria
- **Definite ALS**: UMN + LMN signs in 3 regions
- **Probable ALS**: UMN + LMN in 2 regions
- EMG can substitute for clinical LMN signs (Awaji modification)

### EMG Findings in ALS
| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Widespread denervation | Multiple myotomes, regions |
| Active denervation | Fibrillations, positive sharp waves |
| Chronic reinnervation | Large, polyphasic MUAPs |
| Fasciculations | With other abnormalities |
| Normal sensory NCS | Distinguishes from neuropathy |

### Regions Examined
1. **Bulbar**: Tongue, face, sternocleidomastoid
2. **Cervical**: C5-T1 myotomes
3. **Thoracic**: Paraspinal muscles (important!)
4. **Lumbosacral**: L2-S1 myotomes

### Mimics to Exclude
| Condition | EMG Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Cervical myelopathy | Limited to cervical distribution |
| Multifocal motor neuropathy | Conduction block, normal sensory |
| Kennedy disease | Sensory NCS abnormal, slow progression |
| Inclusion body myositis | Myopathic features |
| Post-polio syndrome | Old, stable denervation |

## Other Applications

### Peripheral Neuropathy
- **Axonal**: Reduced amplitudes, normal velocities
- **Demyelinating**: Slowed velocities, conduction block
- Distribution: Length-dependent vs multifocal

### Myopathy
- Small, polyphasic, early-recruiting MUAPs
- Spontaneous activity in inflammatory myopathy
- Normal NCS

### Radiculopathy
- Denervation limited to single root distribution
- Paraspinal involvement confirms root level
- Normal NCS (unless very severe)

## Relationships

### Conditions
- → [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]] (condition) - *Essential for diagnosis*
- → [[Peripheral Neuropathy]] (condition) - *Classification*
- → [[Multifocal Motor Neuropathy]] (condition) - *ALS mimic*
- → [[Myopathy]] (condition) - *Differentiation*
- → [[Radiculopathy]] (condition) - *Localization*

### Brain/Spinal Regions
- → [[Spinal Cord]] (organ) - *Anterior horn cells*
- → [[Motor Cortex]] (organ) - *UMN source*

### Biomarkers
- → [[Neurofilament Light Chain]] (biomarker) - *Correlates in ALS*
- → [[Creatine Kinase]] (biomarker) - *Muscle damage*

### Related Examinations
- ← [[MRI Brain and Spine]] (examination) - *Exclude structural*
- ← [[Genetic Testing]] (examination) - *SOD1, C9orf72*

## Interpretation Principles

### For ALS Diagnosis
1. Evidence of LMN degeneration (EMG)
2. Evidence of UMN degeneration (clinical)
3. Progressive spread
4. Exclusion of other causes

### EMG Report Components
- NCS summary (motor, sensory, F-waves)
- Spontaneous activity by muscle
- MUAP characteristics
- Recruitment pattern
- Summary and clinical correlation

### Limitations
- Operator-dependent
- Patient discomfort (needle)
- Snapshot in time (may need repeat)
- Cannot detect UMN involvement

## Practical Considerations

### Patient Preparation
- Explain procedure (surface stimulation, needle insertion)
- Avoid lotions/creams (electrode contact)
- Warm limbs (cold slows conduction)
- Anticoagulation not contraindication

### Sampling Strategy
- Proximal and distal muscles per limb
- Multiple nerve territories
- Include thoracic paraspinals (often diagnostic)
- Balance thoroughness with patient tolerance

### Safety
- Minimal risk from needle EMG
- Avoid anticoagulated patients near vital structures
- Infection risk extremely low
- No lasting effects
