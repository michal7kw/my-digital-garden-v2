# Mitochondria

## Description

Mitochondria are double-membrane-bound organelles found in most eukaryotic organisms. They generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy, through cellular respiration.

## Structure

- **Outer membrane**: Permeable to small molecules
- **Intermembrane space**: Contains cytochrome c
- **Inner membrane**: Contains electron transport chain complexes
- **Matrix**: Contains TCA cycle enzymes, mtDNA

## Key Metabolic Functions

### Energy Production
- **[[Citric Acid Cycle]]**: Oxidizes acetyl-CoA to CO₂, generates NADH/FADH₂
- **[[Electron Transport Chain]]**: Transfers electrons, pumps protons
- **[[Oxidative Phosphorylation]]**: ATP synthesis via [[ATP Synthase]]
- **[[Beta-Oxidation]]**: Fatty acid catabolism for acetyl-CoA

### Key Metabolites
- **[[ATP]]**: Primary energy output
- **[[NADH]]** / **[[NAD+]]**: Electron carriers
- **[[FADH2]]**: Electron carrier for Complex II
- **[[Acetyl-CoA]]**: Central metabolic hub
- **[[Pyruvate]]**: Glycolysis endpoint, enters as acetyl-CoA

### Regulation of Biogenesis
- **[[PGC-1alpha]]**: Master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis
- **[[TFAM]]**: mtDNA replication and transcription
- **[[NRF2]]**: Antioxidant defense
- **[[AMPK]]**: Energy sensor, activates biogenesis
- **[[SIRT1]]** / **[[SIRT3]]**: NAD+-dependent regulation

## Supplement Support

| Supplement | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **[[CoQ10]]** | Electron carrier (Complex I → III) |
| **[[PQQ]]** | Induces biogenesis via PGC-1α |
| **[[NMN]]** / **[[Nicotinamide Riboside]]** | NAD+ precursors for sirtuins |
| **[[Alpha Lipoic Acid]]** | PDH/α-KGDH cofactor |
| **[[Creatine]]** | ATP buffer via phosphocreatine |
| **[[Resveratrol]]** | SIRT1 activation |
| **[[Berberine]]** | AMPK activation |

## Clinical Relevance

- **Aging**: Mitochondrial dysfunction central to aging
- **Neurodegeneration**: High neuronal energy demands
- **Metabolic disease**: Impaired oxidative capacity
- **Exercise adaptation**: Biogenesis enhances capacity

## Recent Research (2024-2026)

- **Sleep:** A 2025 study identified mitochondrial "electrical stress" (electron leak) as the direct driver of sleep pressure in the brain. [[Nature 2025 Sleep and Mitochondria]]
- **Uncoupling:** The uncoupler BAM15 was shown to reverse sarcopenic obesity and extend lifespan by mimicking exercise. [[2025 BAM15 Mitochondrial Uncoupling Review]]
- **Transplantation:** First human trials of "Mitotherapy" (mitochondrial transplantation) began in late 2025. [[2025 Mitrix Bio Mitochondrial Transplantation Trial]]
- **Stress Control:** miR-71 identified as a master regulator of mitochondrial stress signaling. [[Nat Comm 2026 miR-71 Mitochondrial Stress]]
