# Mitochondria

## Overview
Mitochondria are crucial organelles within eukaryotic cells, often referred to as the 'powerhouses' of the cell. They are primarily responsible for generating the majority of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy. This process, known as cellular respiration, is vital for nearly all metabolic activities.
