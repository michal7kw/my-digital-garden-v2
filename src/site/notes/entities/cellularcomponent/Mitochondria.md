# Mitochondria

## Description

Mitochondria are double-membrane-bound organelles found in most eukaryotic organisms. They generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy, through cellular respiration.

## Structure

- **Outer membrane**: Permeable to small molecules
- **Intermembrane space**: Contains cytochrome c
- **Inner membrane**: Contains electron transport chain complexes
- **Matrix**: Contains TCA cycle enzymes, mtDNA

## Key Metabolic Functions

### Energy Production
- **[[entities/pathway/Citric Acid Cycle\|Citric Acid Cycle]]**: Oxidizes acetyl-CoA to CO₂, generates NADH/FADH₂
- **[[entities/pathway/Electron Transport Chain\|Electron Transport Chain]]**: Transfers electrons, pumps protons
- **[[entities/pathway/Oxidative Phosphorylation\|Oxidative Phosphorylation]]**: ATP synthesis via [[entities/protein/ATP Synthase\|ATP Synthase]]
- **[[entities/pathway/Beta-Oxidation\|Beta-Oxidation]]**: Fatty acid catabolism for acetyl-CoA

### Key Metabolites
- **[[entities/Metabolite/ATP\|ATP]]**: Primary energy output
- **[[entities/Metabolite/NADH\|NADH]]** / **[[entities/Metabolite/NAD+\|NAD+]]**: Electron carriers
- **[[entities/Metabolite/FADH2\|FADH2]]**: Electron carrier for Complex II
- **[[entities/Metabolite/Acetyl-CoA\|Acetyl-CoA]]**: Central metabolic hub
- **[[entities/Metabolite/Pyruvate\|Pyruvate]]**: Glycolysis endpoint, enters as acetyl-CoA

### Regulation of Biogenesis
- **[[entities/protein/PGC-1alpha\|PGC-1alpha]]**: Master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis
- **[[entities/protein/TFAM\|TFAM]]**: mtDNA replication and transcription
- **[[entities/protein/NRF2\|NRF2]]**: Antioxidant defense
- **[[entities/protein/AMPK\|AMPK]]**: Energy sensor, activates biogenesis
- **[[entities/protein/SIRT1\|SIRT1]]** / **[[entities/protein/SIRT3\|SIRT3]]**: NAD+-dependent regulation

## Supplement Support

| Supplement | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **[[CoQ10\|CoQ10]]** | Electron carrier (Complex I → III) |
| **[[entities/Supplement/PQQ\|PQQ]]** | Induces biogenesis via PGC-1α |
| **[[entities/Supplement/NMN\|NMN]]** / **[[entities/Metabolite/Nicotinamide Riboside\|Nicotinamide Riboside]]** | NAD+ precursors for sirtuins |
| **[[entities/Supplement/Alpha Lipoic Acid\|Alpha Lipoic Acid]]** | PDH/α-KGDH cofactor |
| **[[entities/drug/Creatine\|Creatine]]** | ATP buffer via phosphocreatine |
| **[[entities/Supplement/Resveratrol\|Resveratrol]]** | SIRT1 activation |
| **[[entities/drug/Berberine\|Berberine]]** | AMPK activation |

## Clinical Relevance

- **Aging**: Mitochondrial dysfunction central to aging
- **Neurodegeneration**: High neuronal energy demands
- **Metabolic disease**: Impaired oxidative capacity
- **Exercise adaptation**: Biogenesis enhances capacity
