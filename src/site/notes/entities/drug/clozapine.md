# Clozapine

## Overview
Clozapine is the prototype **atypical antipsychotic**. It is the gold standard for **treatment-resistant schizophrenia** (defined as failing at least two other antipsychotics). Unlike typical antipsychotics, it carries a very low risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia.

However, its use is limited by serious side effects, most notably **agranulocytosis** (severe drop in white blood cells), which requires mandatory regular blood monitoring (REMS program in the US). Other risks include myocarditis, seizures, and metabolic syndrome.

## Indications
- **Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia**: FDA approved.
- **Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia**: FDA approved (only antipsychotic with this indication).
- **Psychosis in Parkinson's Disease**: Off-label, often effective at low doses.
