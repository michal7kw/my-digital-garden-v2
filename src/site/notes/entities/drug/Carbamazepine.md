# Carbamazepine

## Overview
Carbamazepine is a first-generation anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer. It is considered the gold standard for **trigeminal neuralgia** and is a first-line treatment for **partial seizures** and **bipolar disorder** (acute manic/mixed episodes).

It is a potent **inducer of CYP3A4** and other hepatic enzymes (including its own metabolism - auto-induction), making drug-drug interactions a major clinical consideration.

## Indications
- **Epilepsy**: Partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
- **Trigeminal Neuralgia**: First-line therapy for pain relief.
- **Bipolar Disorder**: Acute manic or mixed episodes.
- **Neuropathic Pain**: Diabetic neuropathy (off-label).

### Modulates Protein
- ⊣ [[Sodium Channel\|Sodium Channel]] (protein) - *Blocks voltage-gated Na+ channels*
- → [[entities/gene/CYP3A4\|CYP3A4]] (protein) - *Induces expression (Auto-induction)*

### Drug Interactions
- ↔ [[Warfarin\|Warfarin]] - *Decreases effect (via CYP induction)*
