# MCT8 Oil (Caprylic Acid)

## Overview
MCT oil, particularly formulations rich in caprylic acid (C8), has gained popularity for its ability to quickly provide energy and support brain function. Unlike long-chain fatty acids, MCTs are rapidly absorbed and converted into ketones, which can serve as an efficient fuel source, especially beneficial in ketogenic diets.
