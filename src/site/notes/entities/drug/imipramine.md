# Imipramine

## Overview
Imipramine was the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) discovered (1950s) and set the standard for antidepressant therapy for decades. While replaced by SSRIs for depression due to side effects, it remains unique in its efficacy for **nocturnal enuresis** (childhood bedwetting) and certain neuropathic pain conditions.

Its metabolite, Desipramine, is also a potent antidepressant with a different receptor profile (more norepinephrine-selective).

## Indications
- **Major Depressive Disorder**: Effective but second-line.
- **Nocturnal Enuresis**: FDA approved for children >6 years.
- **Panic Disorder**: Effective (off-label).
- **Neuropathic Pain**: Off-label use.
