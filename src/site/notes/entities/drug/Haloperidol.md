# Haloperidol

## Overview
Haloperidol is a high-potency **typical antipsychotic** of the butyrophenone class. It is one of the most frequently used antipsychotics in emergency settings for **acute agitation** or psychosis due to its rapid onset (especially IM) and relatively clean cardiovascular profile (less hypotension than chlorpromazine).

However, its high affinity for D2 receptors in the striatum leads to a high incidence of **Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)**, such as dystonia, akathisia, and parkinsonism.

## Indications
- **Schizophrenia**: Acute and maintenance treatment.
- **Acute Psychosis/Agitation**: Emergency management.
- **Tourette Syndrome**: Control of tics.
- **Delirium**: Often used in ICU settings (though evidence is debated).
- **Huntington's Disease**: Chorea management.
