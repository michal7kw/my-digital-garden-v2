# Doxepin

## Overview
Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that is widely used today for **insomnia** (at low doses) and **pruritus** (itching, often topical) due to its extremely potent **antihistamine** effects. While effective for depression and anxiety, its side effect profile (sedation, weight gain) often relegates it to second-line status for those conditions.

At very low doses (3-6 mg), it acts almost exclusively as a selective histamine H1 antagonist, promoting sleep maintenance without significant anticholinergic effects.

## Indications
- **Insomnia**: Sleep maintenance (difficulty staying asleep).
- **Depression**: Major Depressive Disorder.
- **Anxiety Disorders**: Generalized anxiety.
- **Pruritus**: Itching (topical cream, e.g., for eczema).
