# Quetiapine

## Overview
Quetiapine (Seroquel) is a widely prescribed **atypical antipsychotic**. It is unique for its broad efficacy spectrum, treating schizophrenia, bipolar mania/depression, and acting as an add-on for major depression.

Low doses (25-100 mg) act primarily as **antihistamines**, causing sedation, which leads to widespread off-label use for insomnia (though controversial due to metabolic side effects). Higher doses (>300 mg) recruit **D2 and 5-HT2A** receptor occupancy for antipsychotic effects.

## Indications
- **Schizophrenia**: Acute and maintenance.
- **Bipolar I Disorder**: Manic and depressive episodes.
- **Major Depressive Disorder**: Adjunctive therapy.
- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**: Off-label.
- **Insomnia**: Off-label (widely used).
