# Creatine

## Overview
Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that plays a vital role in the body's energy production system, particularly in muscle and brain cells. It is widely used as a dietary supplement by athletes and bodybuilders to improve strength, enhance exercise performance, and support muscle growth.

## Health Coach Insights (from recent video)

During a recent health coach video, several key insights about creatine supplementation were shared:

*   **Beyond Muscle Growth**: While widely known for muscle and strength, the coach emphasized creatine's significant benefits for brain health, including improved cognitive function, memory, and protection against neurological diseases. This is particularly relevant for individuals looking to support mental acuity as they age.
*   **Dosage & Loading Phase**: For general health and cognitive benefits, a daily dose of 3-5g was recommended, without necessarily needing a loading phase for sustained use. For acute performance gains, a loading phase (20g/day for 5-7 days) followed by maintenance was suggested.
*   **Safety Profile**: Reaffirmed creatine's excellent safety profile, even with long-term use, dispelling common myths about kidney damage in healthy individuals. Hydration was highlighted as key.
*   **Synergistic Effects**: Mentioned that creatine works synergistically with other supplements like [[entities/drug/Coenzyme Q10\|Coenzyme Q10]] for enhanced mitochondrial function and energy production.

## Publications & Further Reading

Here are some of the interesting publications mentioned by the health coach that warrant further investigation:
