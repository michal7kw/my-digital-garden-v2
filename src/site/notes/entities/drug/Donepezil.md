# Donepezil

## Overview
Donepezil (Aricept) is the most widely prescribed drug for **Alzheimer's Disease**. It targets the **cholinergic deficit** characteristic of AD by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine.

While it does not stop the underlying neurodegeneration (amyloid/tau pathology), it provides modest symptomatic improvement in cognition and function for 6-12 months.

## Indications
- **Alzheimer's Disease**: Mild, Moderate, and Severe stages.
- **Lewy Body Dementia**: Off-label.
- **Vascular Dementia**: Off-label.
