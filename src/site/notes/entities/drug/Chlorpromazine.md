# Chlorpromazine

## Overview
Chlorpromazine was the first antipsychotic drug developed (1950s), revolutionizing the treatment of schizophrenia. It is a low-potency **typical antipsychotic** of the phenothiazine class.

While less commonly used today for long-term psychosis due to side effects (tardive dyskinesia, sedation), it remains useful for acute agitation, severe nausea/vomiting, and intractable hiccups (singultus).

## Indications
- **Schizophrenia**: Especially positive symptoms.
- **Bipolar Disorder**: Acute manic episodes.
- **Nausea and Vomiting**: Severe cases.
- **Intractable Hiccups**: FDA approved indication.
- **Acute Intermittent Porphyria**: Adjunct treatment.
- **Tetanus**: Adjunct treatment.
