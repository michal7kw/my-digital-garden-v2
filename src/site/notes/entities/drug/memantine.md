# Memantine

## Overview
Memantine (Namenda) represents a distinct class of Alzheimer's treatment. Unlike cholinesterase inhibitors (which boost signal), Memantine reduces **noise** (excitotoxicity).

In Alzheimer's, damaged neurons release excessive **Glutamate**, which overstimulates NMDA receptors, leading to toxic Calcium influx and cell death. Memantine blocks this "tonic" overstimulation without interfering with the "phasic" signals required for learning.

## Indications
- **Alzheimer's Disease**: Moderate to Severe (often combined with Donepezil).
- **Vascular Dementia**: Off-label.
