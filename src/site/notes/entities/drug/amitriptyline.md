# Amitriptyline

## Overview
Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) first introduced in the 1960s. While its use as a first-line antidepressant has declined due to side effects compared to SSRIs, it remains a gold standard treatment for **neuropathic pain**, **migraine prophylaxis**, and **fibromyalgia**.

It functions as a "dirty drug," meaning it affects multiple receptor systems. Its primary therapeutic effect comes from inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their synaptic availability. However, its antagonism of histamine (H1), muscarinic (mACh), and alpha-adrenergic receptors contributes to its side effect profile (sedation, dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension).

## Indications
- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Effective but often second-line.
- **Neuropathic Pain**: Diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia.
- **Migraine Prophylaxis**: Effective at lower doses.
- **Fibromyalgia**: Improvements in pain and sleep quality.
- **Insomnia**: Off-label use due to strong sedative effects.
