# forever_chemicals_pfas_exposure

Tests blood for exposure to “forever chemicals” (PFAS), harmful substances linked to health risks like endocrine disruption, metabolic disorders, and cancer. Most people are unaware of their exposure to “forever chemicals,” or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are found in the blood of 97% of Americans. PFAS are present in everyday items like nonstick cookware, water- and stain-resistant fabrics, food packaging, fire-fighting foam, and contaminated water. They can accumulate in the body over time, posing serious health risks. Emerging evidence suggests that PFAS may impact the liver, immune, endocrine, metabolic, reproductive, nervous, and skeletal systems while also being associated with an increased risk of cancer and developmental delays.
