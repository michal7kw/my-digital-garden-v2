This comprehensive set of tests provides a deeper understanding of cardiovascular and metabolic health by evaluating how effectively cholesterol is working, how the body manages blood sugar (including insulin resistance), levels of harmful oxidative stress that can damage cells kidney function, and risks related to blood clotting. These tests are rarely available but trusted and used by top cardiologists.

Strategies like reducing inflammation, improving gut health, and supporting the body’s natural detoxification processes can promote both heart and metabolic health.
