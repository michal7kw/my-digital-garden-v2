## Overview
Tests for latent viruses like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpesviruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and hepatitis B and C, which helps identify infections that can remain dormant in the body and reactivate under certain conditions, particularly in people with weakened immune systems. EBV is present in up to 95% of adults globally, while CMV and other herpesviruses are also widespread. Hepatitis B and C are less common but have significant impacts on liver health, with the potential to cause serious dysfunction if reactivated. Early detection through testing supports targeted strategies, including immune support, lifestyle adjustments, and antiviral therapies, to prevent complications and manage long-term health risks.
