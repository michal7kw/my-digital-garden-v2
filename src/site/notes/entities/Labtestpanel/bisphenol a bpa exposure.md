## Overview
Measures your urine levels of Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor found in plastics that is associated with hormone disruption and metabolic health issues. BPA is found in plastics, canned foods, thermal paper receipts, and cosmetics that can interfere with hormones and potentially contribute to reproductive issues, metabolic disorders, blood sugar dysregulation, and cardiovascular diseases. This test helps detect and monitor exposure to BPA, guiding interventions to reduce exposure and support detoxification with hydration and a nutrient-rich diet to help lower BPA levels. Included biomarkers (1) Bisphenol A (BPA), Urine
