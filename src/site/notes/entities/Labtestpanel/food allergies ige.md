Food-specific IgE testing identifies immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses associated with true food allergies, meaning allergies that cause immediate and potentially severe reactions, such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or anaphylaxis. Elevated IgE antibodies confirm an allergic reaction to specific foods, which may require complete avoidance and emergency management plans, including carrying an epinephrine injector. Results should be used in conjunction with clinical symptoms and a detailed medical history for accurate diagnosis and management.
