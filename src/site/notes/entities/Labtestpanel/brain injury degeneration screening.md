Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a protein biomarker released during nerve cell damage and is a valuable tool for detecting active neuronal injury. It is used in the evaluation of conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) from sports impacts, car accidents, and falls. NfL aids in early detection, disease progression monitoring, and treatment evaluation. Included biomarkers (1) Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL)
