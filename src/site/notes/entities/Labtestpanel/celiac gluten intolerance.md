# celiac_gluten_intolerance

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the intestinal lining in response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, affecting an estimated 1 in 141 Americans, though most cases go undiagnosed. This test detects antibodies to identify abnormal immune reactions to gluten and can provide insight into symptoms such as digestive discomfort, fatigue, or nutrient deficiencies. It also includes a check for Immunoglobulin A (IgA), an important antibody in the immune system. IgA deficiency, which can impair the body's ability to fight infections, may cause falsely negative results in IgA-based tests. In such cases, alternative markers like Immunoglobulin G (IgG) are used for more reliable results.
