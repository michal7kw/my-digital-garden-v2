Food-specific IgG testing identifies immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses associated with potential food sensitivities or intolerances.

These responses may help identify foods that contribute to chronic inflammation, digestive issues, and conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), migraines, and certain autoimmune diseases Included biomarkers (11) Codfish Sensitivity Wheat Sensitivity Soybean Sensitivity Peanut Sensitivity Egg White Sensitivity Yeast Sensitivity Maize / Corn Sensitivity Coffee Sensitivity Casein Sensitivity Tomato Sensitivity Cacao Sensitivity
