# genetic_heart_risks

Identify genetic markers linked to atrial fibrillation, heart attacks, strokes, and coronary artery disease to inform personalized heart health strategies. These genetic tests help assess the risk of developing serious heart-related conditions, including irregular heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation), heart attacks (myocardial infarction), strokes, and coronary artery disease. Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death globally and in the United States, affecting millions each year. These tests identify specific genetic predispositions, which provide critical knowledge to guide prevention and reduce the risk of severe complications like heart attacks and strokes. Included biomarkers (5) 9p21 Genotype: rs1333049 4q25-Atrial Fibrillation Risk: rs2200733 9p21 Genotype: rs10757278 4q25-Atrial Fibrillation Risk: rs10033464 LPA Aspirin Genotype
