# Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

## Overview

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. It involves the accumulation of functionally incompetent B cells in the blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. It typically progresses more slowly than acute leukemias. Many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, detected via routine blood tests showing high white blood cell counts.

## Pathophysiology

CLL cells are monoclonal B lymphocytes that express CD5 and CD19. They accumulate because they do not die as they should (defective apoptosis) rather than dividing too rapidly.
