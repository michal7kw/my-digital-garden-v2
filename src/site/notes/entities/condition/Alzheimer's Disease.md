# Alzheimer's Disease

## Overview
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition characterized by the progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Pathologically, it is defined by the accumulation of **Amyloid-Beta (Aβ)** plaques and **Tau** neurofibrillary tangles, leading to synaptic failure and neuronal death.

## Key Mechanisms
1.  **Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis**: Imbalance between Aβ production (via BACE1/Gamma-secretase) and clearance leads to oligomerization and plaque formation.
2.  **Tau Pathology**: Hyperphosphorylation of Tau causes microtubule disintegration and tangle formation.
3.  **Cholinergic Hypothesis**: Loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain contributes to cognitive decline.
4.  **Genetic Risk**: APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD.
