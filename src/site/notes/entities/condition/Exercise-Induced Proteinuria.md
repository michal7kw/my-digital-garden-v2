# Exercise-Induced Proteinuria

## Overview

Exercise-induced proteinuria is a common finding after intense physical exertion. It is thought to result from temporary changes in glomerular permeability and tubular reabsorption due to hemodynamic stress and sympathetic activation. It typically resolves within 24–48 hours of rest and is not indicative of kidney disease.

## Clinical Significance

It is important to distinguish this transient state from persistent **Proteinuria**, which may signal underlying nephropathy. A repeat test after 48 hours of rest is recommended for confirmation.
