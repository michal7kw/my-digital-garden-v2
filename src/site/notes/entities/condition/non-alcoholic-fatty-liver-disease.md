<h1>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), recently renamed <strong>Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)</strong>, is the accumulation of excess fat in the liver. It is the most common chronic liver disease globally. It ranges from simple fatty liver (steatosis) to <strong>Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)</strong>, which involves inflammation and liver cell damage, potentially progressing to cirrhosis and liver failure.</p>
<h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
<p>It is closely linked to <strong>insulin resistance</strong> and metabolic syndrome. Excess free fatty acids and carbohydrates are converted to triglycerides in the liver.</p>
