# Stomach Neoplasms

## Overview

Stomach Neoplasms (Gastric Cancer) usually begin in the mucus-producing cells that line the stomach (adenocarcinoma). It develops slowly over many years. Early changes in the lining (precancerous changes) rarely cause symptoms, so it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage.

## Types

- **Adenocarcinoma:** (90-95% of cancers).
- **Lymphoma.**
- **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST).**
- **Carcinoid Tumor.**
