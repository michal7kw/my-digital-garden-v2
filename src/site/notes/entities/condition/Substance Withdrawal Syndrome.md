# Substance Withdrawal Syndrome

## Overview

Substance Withdrawal Syndrome occurs when an individual who is physically dependent on a substance (like alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines) stops or drastically reduces their use. The symptoms are the body's reaction to the absence of the substance it has adapted to.

## Common Syndromes

- **Alcohol Withdrawal:** Can be life-threatening (Delirium Tremens).
- **Opioid Withdrawal:** Extremely uncomfortable (flu-like) but rarely fatal.
- **Benzodiazepine Withdrawal:** High seizure risk.
