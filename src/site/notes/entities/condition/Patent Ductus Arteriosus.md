# Patent Ductus Arteriosus

## Overview

Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) is a persistent opening between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart. The **ductus arteriosus** is a normal part of a baby's circulatory system before birth that usually closes shortly after birth. If it remains open, it allows oxygen-rich blood from the aorta to mix with oxygen-poor blood in the pulmonary artery, straining the heart and increasing blood pressure in the lung arteries.

## Complications

- **Heart Failure:** Due to volume overload.
- **Pulmonary Hypertension:** High blood pressure in the lungs.
- **Endocarditis:** Infection of the heart lining.
- **Eisenmenger Syndrome:** Irreversible lung damage leading to cyanosis.
