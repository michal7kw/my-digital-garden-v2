# Candidiasis

## Overview

Candidiasis (Yeast Infection) occurs when the normal balance of microorganisms is disrupted, allowing **Candida** to overgrow. It can be superficial (skin/mouth/vagina) or systemic (**Candidemia**), the latter being a life-threatening emergency in immunocompromised patients.

## Key Types

- **Oral Thrush:** Affects the mouth and throat.
- **Vulvovaginal Candidiasis:** Common vaginal yeast infection.
- **Cutaneous Candidiasis:** Affects skin folds (intertrigo).
- **Invasive Candidiasis:** Spreads through the bloodstream.
