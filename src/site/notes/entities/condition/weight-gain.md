# Weight Gain

## Overview

Weight gain occurs when you take in more calories than your body uses. While often related to diet and exercise, unexplained or rapid weight gain can be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, such as hormonal imbalances or fluid retention (**Edema**).

## Potential Medical Causes

- **Hypothyroidism:** Underactive thyroid slows metabolism.
- **Cushing's Syndrome:** Excess cortisol.
- **PCOS:** Hormonal imbalance in women.
- **Heart/Kidney/Liver Failure:** Causes fluid buildup.
- **Depression:** Changes in eating/activity levels.
