# Chronic Kidney Disease

## Overview

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time. If kidney function continues to decline, it can lead to **End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)**, requiring dialysis or a transplant. CKD is often "silent" until advanced stages.

## Stages

- **Stage 1-2:** Mildly decreased GFR with evidence of kidney damage.
- **Stage 3:** Moderately decreased GFR (30-59 mL/min).
- **Stage 4:** Severely decreased GFR (15-29 mL/min).
- **Stage 5:** Kidney failure (<15 mL/min).
