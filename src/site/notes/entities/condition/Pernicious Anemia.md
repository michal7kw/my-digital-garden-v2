# Pernicious Anemia

## Overview

Pernicious Anemia is a specific type of **B12 Deficiency Anemia**. It is caused by an autoimmune attack on the parietal cells of the stomach, which produce **Intrinsic Factor**. Without intrinsic factor, the body cannot absorb B12 in the terminal ileum. Chronic deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage.
