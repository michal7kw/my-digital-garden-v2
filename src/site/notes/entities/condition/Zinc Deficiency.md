# Zinc Deficiency

## Overview

Zinc is a critical cofactor for over 300 enzymes. Deficiency affects almost all aspects of health, particularly **Immune Function** and cell division. While severe deficiency is rare in developed countries, subclinical deficiency is common and can impair growth, cognitive development, and resistance to infections.

## Clinical Manifestations

- **Skin/Hair:** Dermatitis, brittle nails, alopecia.
- **Reproductive:** Delayed puberty, hypogonadism.
- **Neurological:** Mood changes, irritability.
