# Ankylosing Spondylitis

## Overview

Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the sacroiliac joints and the spine. Over time, it can cause some of the bones in the spine (vertebrae) to fuse together, making the spine less flexible and resulting in a hunched-forward posture (bamboo spine).
