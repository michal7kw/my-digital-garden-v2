# Cardiovascular Diseases

## Overview

Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. They encompass a wide range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. **Atherosclerosis** (plaque buildup in arteries) is the underlying cause of many CVDs.

## Common Types

- **Coronary Heart Disease (CHD):** Disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle.
- **Cerebrovascular Disease:** Disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain (Stroke).
- **Peripheral Arterial Disease:** Disease of blood vessels supplying arms and legs.
- **Rheumatic Heart Disease:** Damage to the heart muscle and valves from rheumatic fever.
- **Congenital Heart Disease:** Malformations of heart structure existing at birth.
- **Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism.**
