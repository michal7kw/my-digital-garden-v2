# Ocular Hypertension

## Overview

Ocular Hypertension refers to Intraocular Pressure (IOP) consistently above the normal range (usually >21 mmHg) in the absence of optic nerve damage or visual field loss. It is a major risk factor for developing **Glaucoma**. It occurs when the eye produces too much fluid (aqueous humor) or it drains too slowly.

## Treatment

Not all cases require treatment. The decision to treat is based on the risk of progression to glaucoma. Treatment involves lowering IOP.
