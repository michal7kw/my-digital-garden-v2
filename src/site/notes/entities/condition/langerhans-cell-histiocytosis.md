# Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis

## Overview

Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease, historically considered an immune disorder but now often classified as an inflammatory myeloid neoplasm. It involves the overproduction of Langerhans cells (a type of dendritic cell) which accumulate in various organs—bones, skin, lungs, liver, spleen—causing lesions and organ dysfunction. It primarily affects children but can occur in adults.

## Pathophysiology

Recent research identifies somatic mutations in the **MAPK pathway** (most commonly *BRAF V600E*) as a key driver of the disease.
