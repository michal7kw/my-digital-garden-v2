# Osteomyelitis

## Overview

Osteomyelitis is inflammation of bone caused by infection, usually by bacteria (*Staphylococcus aureus*). Organisms can reach the bone by traveling through the bloodstream (hematogenous) or spreading from nearby tissue. Infections can also begin in the bone itself if an injury exposes the bone to germs.

## Causes

- **Bacteria:** *Staphylococcus aureus* (most common), *Pseudomonas*, *Salmonella*.
- **Fungi:** Rare.
