# Myocardial Infarction

## Overview

Myocardial Infarction (MI), or heart attack, is a medical emergency. It is most often caused by the rupture of an **Atherosclerotic Plaque**, which triggers the formation of a thrombus (blood clot). This results in ischemia and subsequent necrosis of the myocardium (heart muscle).

## Types

- **STEMI:** ST-Elevation MI; indicates complete artery blockage.
- **NSTEMI:** Non-ST-Elevation MI; usually indicates partial blockage.
- **Type 2 MI:** Ischemia due to demand-supply imbalance (e.g., severe anemia or tachycardia).
