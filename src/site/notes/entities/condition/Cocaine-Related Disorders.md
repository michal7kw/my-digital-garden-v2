# Cocaine-Related Disorders

## Overview

Cocaine-Related Disorders include acute toxicity, addiction (Use Disorder), and withdrawal syndromes associated with cocaine, a powerful central nervous system stimulant. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of **dopamine**, serotonin, and norepinephrine, leading to intense euphoria and increased energy, followed by severe depletion and craving.

## Complications

- **Cardiovascular:** Heart attack, arrhythmia, stroke, sudden cardiac death.
- **Neurological:** Seizures, headaches, cognitive impairment.
- **Psychiatric:** Anxiety, paranoia, psychosis ("cocaine bugs"), depression.
- **Respiratory:** "Crack lung" (if smoked), nasal septum perforation (if snorted).
