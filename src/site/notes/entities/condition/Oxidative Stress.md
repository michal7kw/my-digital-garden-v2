# Oxidative Stress

## Overview

Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical production and the body's antioxidant defenses. It is closely linked to mitochondrial function as mitochondria are both primary generators and targets of reactive oxygen species.

## Mitochondrial Connection

Mitochondria are the main source of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the electron transport chain. The review by Malinska et al. highlights oxidative stress as a key mechanism through which nicotine affects cellular function.
