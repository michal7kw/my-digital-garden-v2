# Polycythemia Vera

## Overview

Polycythemia Vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. The primary driver is a mutation in the **JAK2** gene. The thickened blood (hyperviscosity) can lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart attack, or pulmonary embolism.

## Complications

- **Thrombosis:** Blood clots in veins or arteries.
- **Splenomegaly:** Enlarged spleen.
- **Myelofibrosis:** Progression to bone marrow scarring.
- **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).**
