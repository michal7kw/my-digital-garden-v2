# Marijuana Abuse

## Overview

Marijuana Abuse, or **Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD)**, occurs when an individual continues to use cannabis despite significant health, social, or occupational problems. While often perceived as less addictive than other substances, about 30% of users may have some degree of CUD. It affects the brain's reward system, particularly cannabinoid receptors.

## Withdrawal

Symptoms typically begin within 24-72 hours of cessation, peak within the first week, and last 1-2 weeks.
- Irritability/Anger
- Nervousness/Anxiety
- Sleep difficulties
- Decreased appetite
- Depressed mood
