# Primary Biliary Cholangitis

## Overview

Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), formerly called Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the small bile ducts inside the liver. This causes bile to back up (**Cholestasis**), causing damage to liver cells and leading to **Cirrhosis**.

## Diagnosis

- **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):** Elevated.
- **Anti-Mitochondrial Antibody (AMA):** Present in 95% of patients (key marker).
- **Liver Biopsy:** To assess stage.
