# Kidney Calculi

## Overview

Kidney Calculi (Kidney Stones or Nephrolithiasis) form when urine becomes concentrated, allowing minerals to crystallize and stick together. They can range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. Passing stones can be incredibly painful, but they usually cause no permanent damage if recognized early.

## Types

1.  **Calcium Stones:** (Most common) Usually Calcium Oxalate.
2.  **Struvite Stones:** Form in response to a urinary tract infection.
3.  **Uric Acid Stones:** Form in people who don't drink enough fluid or lose too much fluid, eat a high-protein diet, or have gout.
4.  **Cystine Stones:** Caused by a hereditary disorder (cystinuria).
