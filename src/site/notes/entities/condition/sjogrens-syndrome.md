# Sjogrens Syndrome

## Overview

Sjogren's Syndrome primarily affects the exocrine glands. It can be **Primary** (occurring alone) or **Secondary** (associated with another condition like Rheumatoid Arthritis). While dryness is the hallmark, it is a systemic disease that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system.

## Complications

- **Dental Cavities:** Due to lack of saliva.
- **Oral Yeast Infections (Thrush).**
- **Lymphoma:** Small but significant increased risk.
- **Peripheral Neuropathy.**
