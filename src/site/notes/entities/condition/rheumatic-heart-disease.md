# Rheumatic Heart Disease

## Overview

Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) results from **Rheumatic Fever**, an inflammatory disease that can affect connective tissues, especially in the heart, joints, skin, or brain. The heart valves can become inflamed and scarred over time. This narrows or leaks the valve, making it harder for the heart to function normally. It usually starts as a strep throat infection.

## Pathophysiology

An untreated infection with *Group A Streptococcus* bacteria triggers an autoimmune reaction where the body's antibodies attack its own tissues (molecular mimicry), particularly the heart valves.
