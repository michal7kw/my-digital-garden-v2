# Mitochondrial Dysfunction

## Overview
A state of impaired mitochondrial function characterized by reduced ATP production, increased oxidative stress, and defective mitophagy.

## Clinical Presentation
### Symptoms
- Fatigue
- Exercise intolerance
- Muscle weakness
- Cognitive decline (Brain fog)
- Poor recovery

## Diagnostic Information

### Biomarker Patterns
```yaml
'{"elevated": ["Lactate/Pyruvate ratio", "Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)"], "reduced":
  ["ATP levels", "Mitochondrial membrane potential"]}'
```

## Risk Factors
- Aging
- Environmental toxins
- Chronic overnutrition
- Physical inactivity

## Management

### Treatment Approaches
- Mitochondrial nutrients (CoQ10, PQQ)
- Mitophagy inducers (Urolithin A, Spermidine)
- Caloric restriction / Intermittent fasting
- Photobiomodulation (Red Light Therapy)
