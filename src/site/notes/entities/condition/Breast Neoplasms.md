# Breast Neoplasms

## Overview

Breast Neoplasms (Breast Cancer) is the most common cancer in women worldwide. It occurs when cells in the breast divide and grow without control.

## Types

- **Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS):** Non-invasive, stays in ducts.
- **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC):** Most common (80%). Starts in ducts and invades fatty tissue.
- **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC):** Starts in lobules (milk glands).
- **Triple-Negative Breast Cancer:** Aggressive, lacks estrogen/progesterone receptors and HER2.
