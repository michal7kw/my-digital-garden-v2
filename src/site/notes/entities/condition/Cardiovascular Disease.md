# Cardiovascular Disease

## Overview

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality globally. It primarily involves the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels due to **Atherosclerosis**. Early detection of risk factors is critical for prevention.

## Common Types

- **Coronary Artery Disease:** Affects vessels supplying the heart.
- **Cerebrovascular Disease:** Affects vessels supplying the brain (Stroke).
- **Peripheral Arterial Disease:** Affects vessels in the limbs.
- **Heart Failure:** Inability of the heart to pump effectively.
