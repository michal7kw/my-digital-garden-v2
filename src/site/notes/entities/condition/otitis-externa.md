# Otitis Externa

## Overview

Otitis Externa (Swimmer's Ear) is an inflammation, irritation, or infection of the outer ear and ear canal. It usually occurs when water stays in the ear canal for a long time, creating a moist environment that aids bacterial growth. It can also be caused by trauma to the lining of the ear canal (e.g., from cotton swabs).

## Causes

- **Bacteria:** *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (common in water), *Staphylococcus aureus*.
- **Fungi:** *Candida*, *Aspergillus* (less common).
