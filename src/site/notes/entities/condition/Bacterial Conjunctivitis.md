# Bacterial Conjunctivitis

## Overview

Bacterial Conjunctivitis, a common form of "pink eye," involves bacterial infection of the conjunctiva. It is distinguished from viral conjunctivitis by the presence of mucopurulent (pus-like) discharge. While often self-limiting, topical antibiotics can shorten the course and reduce contagion.

## Etiology

- **Staphylococcus aureus:** Common in adults.
- **Streptococcus pneumoniae:** Common in children.
- **Haemophilus influenzae:** Common in children.
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa:** Associated with contact lenses.
- **Neisseria gonorrhoeae / Chlamydia trachomatis:** Severe, hyperacute forms.
