# Diabetes Mellitus

## Overview

Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease that affects how the body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy. In diabetes, the body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it as well as it should.

## Types

- **Type 1 Diabetes:** Autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
- **Type 2 Diabetes:** Characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Strongly linked to lifestyle factors.
- **Gestational Diabetes:** High blood sugar first recognized during pregnancy.
