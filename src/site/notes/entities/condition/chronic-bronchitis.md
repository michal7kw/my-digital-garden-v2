# Chronic Bronchitis

## Overview

Chronic Bronchitis is a type of **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**. It involves long-term inflammation of the bronchi (airways), which leads to excessive mucus production and thickening of the bronchial walls. This narrows the airways, making it difficult to breathe and leading to frequent respiratory infections. It is distinct from acute bronchitis, which is usually a temporary infection.

## Pathophysiology

The primary driver is chronic irritation (most commonly from tobacco smoke) which causes:
1.  **Hypertrophy** of mucus-secreting glands.
2.  **Inflammation** and edema of the bronchial wall.
3.  **Ciliary dysfunction**, preventing clearance of mucus.
