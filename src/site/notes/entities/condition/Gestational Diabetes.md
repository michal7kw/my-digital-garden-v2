# Gestational Diabetes

## Overview

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) that develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth. It occurs because the placenta produces hormones that can cause **insulin resistance**. If the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to overcome this resistance, blood glucose levels rise.

## Complications

**For the Baby:**
- Macrosomia (excessive birth weight).
- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) after birth.
- Respiratory distress syndrome.
- Increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes later in life.

**For the Mother:**
- Preeclampsia (high blood pressure).
- C-section delivery.
- Higher risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes post-pregnancy.
