# Amphetamine-Related Disorders

## Overview

Amphetamine-Related Disorders involve the misuse of amphetamine, methamphetamine, or similar stimulants (e.g., MDMA). These substances increase the release of **dopamine** and norepinephrine. Chronic use leads to neuroadaptive changes, resulting in addiction, cognitive deficits, and potential psychosis.

## Withdrawal

Symptoms include:
- Fatigue
- Vivid, unpleasant dreams
- Insomnia or hypersomnia
- Increased appetite
- Psychomotor retardation
