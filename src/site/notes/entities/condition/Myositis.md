# Myositis

## Overview

Inflammatory Myopathies (Myositis) involve the immune system attacking healthy muscle tissue. **Polymyositis** affects the skeletal muscles on both sides of the body, while **Dermatomyositis** also involves a distinctive skin rash (heliotrope rash).

## Key Types

- **Polymyositis:** Muscle weakness without rash.
- **Dermatomyositis:** Muscle weakness with characteristic skin findings.
- **Inclusion Body Myositis:** Often affects older adults; slow progression.
