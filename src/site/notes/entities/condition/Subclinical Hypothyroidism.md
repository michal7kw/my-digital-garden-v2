# Subclinical Hypothyroidism

## Overview

Subclinical Hypothyroidism (SCH) is defined biochemicaly as an elevated serum **TSH** with a normal **Free T4**. It is often a precursor to overt hypothyroidism. Treatment is controversial, especially for TSH levels < 10 mIU/L, and is often based on the presence of symptoms, age, or pregnancy status.

## Clinical Considerations

- **Progression:** 2–5% of patients per year progress to overt hypothyroidism, especially those with positive **TPO Antibodies**.
- **Cardiovascular Risk:** Linked to increased risk of heart failure and coronary heart disease when TSH > 10.
- **Pregnancy:** Requires aggressive management to prevent fetal developmental issues.
