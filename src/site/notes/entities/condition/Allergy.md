# Allergy

## Overview

Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to a foreign substance — such as pollen, bee venom, pet dander, or food — that doesn't cause a reaction in most people. The immune system produces **IgE** antibodies that travel to cells that release chemicals, causing an allergic reaction.

## Common Types

- **Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever):** Airborne allergens.
- **Food Allergy:** Peanuts, shellfish, milk, etc.
- **Drug Allergy:** Penicillin, NSAIDs.
- **Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema).**
- **Allergic Asthma.**
