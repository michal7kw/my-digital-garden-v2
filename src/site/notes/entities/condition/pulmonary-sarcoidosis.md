# Pulmonary Sarcoidosis

## Overview

Pulmonary Sarcoidosis is the most common form of sarcoidosis, affecting more than 90% of people with the disease. It involves the formation of **non-caseating granulomas** in the lungs. While many cases resolve spontaneously, some progress to permanent lung scarring (**Pulmonary Fibrosis**).

## Pathophysiology

It is thought to be an exaggerated immune response to an unknown environmental antigen in genetically susceptible individuals, involving Th1 cell activation and granuloma formation.
