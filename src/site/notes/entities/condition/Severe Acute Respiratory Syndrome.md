# Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

## Overview

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It appeared in China in 2002 and spread worldwide, but was contained by 2004. No cases have been reported since 2004.

## Pathogenesis

The virus spreads through respiratory droplets. It infects cells in the lungs, leading to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure.
