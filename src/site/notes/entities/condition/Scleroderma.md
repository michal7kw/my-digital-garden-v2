# Scleroderma

## Overview

Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis) involves the overproduction of **Collagen**. It can be **Localized** (skin only) or **Systemic**. Systemic Sclerosis is further divided into **Limited** (CREST syndrome) and **Diffuse** forms. The latter involves significant internal organ damage, particularly to the lungs and kidneys.

## CREST Syndrome (Limited Sclerosis)

- **C**alcinosis: Calcium deposits in skin.
- **R**aynaud's: Spasm of blood vessels in response to cold.
- **E**sophageal dysfunction: Acid reflux/swallowing issues.
- **S**clerodactyly: Thickening of skin on fingers.
- **T**elangiectasia: Dilation of small blood vessels.
