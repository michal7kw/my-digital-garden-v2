# Postpartum Thyroiditis

## Overview

Postpartum Thyroiditis (PPT) is a destructive thyroiditis. It typically presents with a biphasic course: initial **Thyrotoxicosis** (due to hormone leakage) followed by **Hypothyroidism** (as stores are depleted). While most women return to euthyroid state within a year, some develop permanent hypothyroidism.

## Stages

1.  **Hyperthyroid Phase:** Usually 1–4 months postpartum.
2.  **Hypothyroid Phase:** Usually 4–8 months postpartum.
3.  **Recovery:** Resolution within 12–18 months.
