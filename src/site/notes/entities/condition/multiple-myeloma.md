# Multiple Myeloma

## Overview

Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of **Plasma Cells** (a type of white blood cell). Cancerous plasma cells produce an abnormal protein called **M protein** (monoclonal protein) which can damage organs. It is characterized by the "CRAB" criteria: Calcium elevation, Renal insufficiency, Anemia, and Bone lesions.

## Diagnostic Markers

- **M-protein Spike:** Found in serum or urine electrophoresis.
- **Bence-Jones Protein:** Light chains in the urine.
- **Lytic Bone Lesions:** "Punched out" holes on X-rays.
