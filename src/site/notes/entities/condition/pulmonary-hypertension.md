# Pulmonary Hypertension

## Overview

Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries (the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs). The high pressure forces the right side of the heart to work harder to pump blood, eventually causing the heart muscle to weaken and fail (**Cor Pulmonale**).

## WHO Classifications

1.  **Group 1:** Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
2.  **Group 2:** PH due to left heart disease (most common).
3.  **Group 3:** PH due to lung disease/hypoxia (COPD).
4.  **Group 4:** Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH).
5.  **Group 5:** Unclear/multifactorial mechanisms.
