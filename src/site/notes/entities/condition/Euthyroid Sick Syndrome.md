# Euthyroid Sick Syndrome

## Overview

Euthyroid Sick Syndrome (ESS), also known as **Non-thyroidal Illness Syndrome (NTIS)**, involves changes in thyroid hormone metabolism during acute or chronic illness. It is considered a protective adaptation to conserve energy. The most common pattern is a low **Free T3** with a high **Reverse T3**, while TSH remains normal or slightly low.

## Pathophysiology

Cytokines and inflammatory mediators inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which normally converts T4 to T3. This results in decreased active T3 and increased accumulation of the inactive reverse T3.
