# Biliary Obstruction

## Overview

Biliary Obstruction occurs when one of the ducts that carry bile from the liver to the duodenum is blocked. This causes bile to back up into the liver and enter the bloodstream, resulting in jaundice. Common causes include **Choledocholithiasis** (gallstones in the bile duct) and malignancies like **Pancreatic Cancer**.

## Complications

- **Cholangitis:** Life-threatening infection of the bile duct.
- **Biliary Cirrhosis:** Long-term damage to the liver.
- **Pancreatitis.**
