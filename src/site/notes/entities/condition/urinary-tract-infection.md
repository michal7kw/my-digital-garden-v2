# Urinary Tract Infection

## Overview

Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is most commonly caused by bacteria (*Escherichia coli*) entering the urinary tract through the urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder (**Cystitis**) and the urethra (**Urethritis**). However, serious complications can occur if the infection spreads to the kidneys (**Pyelonephritis**).
