# MTHFR Gene Variants

## Overview

The MTHFR gene provides instructions for making the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme. This enzyme is crucial for converting folate into its active form (**5-MTHF**). Variants in this gene can reduce enzyme efficiency, potentially leading to high levels of **Homocysteine**, which is a risk factor for vascular damage and pregnancy complications.

## Key Variants

- **C677T:** Most common; has the greatest impact on enzyme activity. Homozygous (TT) can reduce activity by up to 70%.
- **A1298C:** Lesser impact on enzyme activity but significant if combined with C677T.
