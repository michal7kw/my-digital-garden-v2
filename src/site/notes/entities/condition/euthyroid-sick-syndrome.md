<h1>Euthyroid Sick Syndrome</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Euthyroid Sick Syndrome (ESS), also known as <strong>Non-thyroidal Illness Syndrome (NTIS)</strong>, involves changes in thyroid hormone metabolism during acute or chronic illness. It is considered a protective adaptation to conserve energy. The most common pattern is a low <strong>Free T3</strong> with a high <strong>Reverse T3</strong>, while TSH remains normal or slightly low.</p>
<h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
<p>Cytokines and inflammatory mediators inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which normally converts T4 to T3. This results in decreased active T3 and increased accumulation of the inactive reverse T3.</p>
