# Ovarian Dysfunction

## Overview

Ovarian Dysfunction covers conditions ranging from **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** to **Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)**. It results in an imbalance of estrogen, progesterone, and androgens, impacting not just fertility but also bone density and cardiovascular health.

## Key Types

- **Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI):** Loss of function before age 40.
- **PCOS:** Hormonal imbalance with overproduction of androgens.
- **Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism:** Low hormone levels due to pituitary/hypothalamic issues.
