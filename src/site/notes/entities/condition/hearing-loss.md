# Hearing Loss

## Overview

Hearing loss is a common sensory impairment affecting communication and quality of life. It can occur at any age but is most prevalent in older adults.

## Types

1.  **Sensorineural:** Damage to the inner ear (cochlea) or auditory nerve. Permanent. (e.g., Age-related, Noise-induced).
2.  **Conductive:** Sound cannot get through the outer or middle ear. Often temporary or treatable. (e.g., Earwax, Fluid, Perforated eardrum).
3.  **Mixed:** Combination of both.
