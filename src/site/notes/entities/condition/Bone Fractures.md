# Bone Fractures

## Overview

A bone fracture is a medical condition where the continuity of the bone is broken. Fractures fall into two main categories: **Traumatic fractures** caused by direct force (falls, car accidents) and **Pathologic fractures** caused by disease weakening the bone (osteoporosis, cancer).

## Classification

- **Closed (Simple):** Skin is intact.
- **Open (Compound):** Bone breaks through the skin (high infection risk).
- **Comminuted:** Bone shatters into 3+ pieces.
- **Greenstick:** Incomplete break (common in children).
- **Stress:** Hairline crack from overuse.
