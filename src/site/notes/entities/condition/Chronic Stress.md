# Chronic Stress

## Overview

Chronic Stress occurs when the body's natural "fight or flight" response is triggered repeatedly or stays on for long periods. This results in the sustained release of **Cortisol** and adrenaline, which can damage nearly every system in the body, particularly the cardiovascular and immune systems.

## Physiological Effects

- **HPA Axis Activation:** Sustained cortisol production.
- **Immune Suppression:** Increased susceptibility to infections.
- **Cardiovascular Strain:** Hypertension and increased heart rate.
- **Metabolic Changes:** Insulin resistance and weight gain (visceral fat).
