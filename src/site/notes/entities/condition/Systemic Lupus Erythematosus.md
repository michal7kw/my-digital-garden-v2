# Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

## Overview

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), or simply **Lupus**, is a complex autoimmune disorder. It can affect any part of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys (**Lupus Nephritis**), heart, and lungs. It is characterized by the production of **Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA)** and periods of flares and remission.

## Complications

- **Lupus Nephritis:** Kidney inflammation that can lead to failure.
- **Cardiovascular Disease:** Accelerated atherosclerosis.
- **Neuropsychiatric Lupus:** Cognitive dysfunction, seizures, or psychosis.
- **Antiphospholipid Syndrome:** Increased risk of blood clots.
