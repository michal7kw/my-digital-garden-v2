# Colorectal Neoplasms

## Overview

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women. Most cases begin as small, noncancerous (benign) clumps of cells called **adenomatous polyps**. Over time, some of these polyps can become colon cancers. Screening tests (colonoscopy) can find polyps so they can be removed before they turn into cancer.

## Types

- **Adenocarcinoma:** (95% of cases) Mucus-secreting cells.
- **Carcinoid Tumors:** Hormone-producing cells.
- **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs):** Interstitial cells of Cajal.
- **Lymphoma.**
