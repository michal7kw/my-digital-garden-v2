# Eye Infections

## Overview

Eye infections occur when harmful microorganisms—bacteria, fungi, or viruses—invade any part of the eyeball or surrounding area. Common types include **Conjunctivitis** (pink eye) and **Keratitis** (corneal infection). While many are minor and self-limiting, some (like endophthalmitis) are medical emergencies that can lead to permanent vision loss.

## Common Types

- **Conjunctivitis:** Inflammation of the conjunctiva (viral, bacterial, allergic).
- **Keratitis:** Infection of the cornea.
- **Blepharitis:** Inflammation of the eyelid margins.
- **Stye (Hordeolum):** Infection of an eyelash follicle or oil gland.
- **Endophthalmitis:** Severe infection inside the eye.
