# Pituitary Disorder

## Overview

The pituitary gland regulates most other endocrine glands. Dysfunction can involve overproduction (**Hyperpituitarism**) or underproduction (**Hypopituitarism**) of hormones. Most pituitary disorders are caused by a benign tumor called a **Pituitary Adenoma**.

## Key Conditions

- **Prolactinoma:** Excess prolactin causing reproductive issues.
- **Acromegaly:** Excess growth hormone in adults.
- **Cushing's Disease:** Excess ACTH leading to high cortisol.
- **Diabetes Insipidus:** ADH deficiency leading to excessive thirst/urination.
- **Central Hypothyroidism:** TSH deficiency.
