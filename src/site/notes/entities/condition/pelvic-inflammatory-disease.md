# Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

## Overview

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is an infection of a woman's reproductive organs. It is a complication often caused by some STDs, like chlamydia and gonorrhea. Other infections that are not sexually transmitted can also cause PID. If untreated, it can cause irreversible damage to the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, leading to infertility.

## Complications

- **Infertility:** Scarring of fallopian tubes prevents fertilization.
- **Ectopic Pregnancy:** Fertilized egg implants outside the uterus.
- **Chronic Pelvic Pain.**
- **Tubo-ovarian Abscess.**
