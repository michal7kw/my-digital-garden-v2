# Omega Fatty Acid Imbalance

## Overview

Omega-3 and Omega-6 are essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). While Omega-6 is pro-inflammatory (necessary for acute immune response), Omega-3 is anti-inflammatory. A high Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio (common in modern diets, often >15:1) is linked to chronic low-grade inflammation and increased risk of chronic diseases.

## Clinical Markers

- **Omega-3 Index:** Measurement of EPA and DHA in red blood cell membranes.
- **Omega-6/Omega-3 Ratio:** Ideal ratio is considered to be between 1:1 and 4:1.
