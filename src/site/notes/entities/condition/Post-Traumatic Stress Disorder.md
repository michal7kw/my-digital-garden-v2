# Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

## Overview

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event. Symptoms must last more than a month and be severe enough to interfere with relationships or work to be diagnosed as PTSD.

## Diagnostic Clusters

1.  **Re-experiencing:** Flashbacks, physical symptoms of stress.
2.  **Avoidance:** Staying away from places/events that are reminders.
3.  **Arousal and Reactivity:** Being easily startled, feeling "on edge."
4.  **Cognition and Mood:** Trouble remembering the event, negative thoughts.
