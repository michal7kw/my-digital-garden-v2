# Psychotic Disorders

## Overview

Psychotic disorders are severe mental disorders that cause abnormal thinking and perceptions. People with psychoses lose touch with reality. Two of the main symptoms are **delusions** (false beliefs) and **hallucinations** (false perceptions).

## Types

- **Schizophrenia:** Chronic condition with delusions, hallucinations, and social withdrawal.
- **Schizoaffective Disorder:** Symptoms of schizophrenia + mood disorder (depression/bipolar).
- **Brief Psychotic Disorder:** Short-term psychosis triggered by stress.
- **Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder.**
