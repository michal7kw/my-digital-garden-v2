# Carcinoma

## Overview

Carcinomas are the most common type of cancer. They originate in **epithelial tissue**, which lines the internal and external surfaces of the body. They can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize).

## Major Subtypes

1.  **Adenocarcinoma:** Starts in mucus-producing glandular cells (Breast, Colon, Lung, Prostate).
2.  **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Starts in flat cells lining surfaces (Skin, Esophagus, Lung).
3.  **Basal Cell Carcinoma:** Starts in the base layer of the epidermis (Skin).
4.  **Transitional Cell Carcinoma:** Starts in the urinary tract lining (Bladder).
