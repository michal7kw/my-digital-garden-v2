# Chronic Inflammation

## Overview
Chronic inflammation is a persistent, low-grade inflammation that can silently damage tissues and organs over time. Unlike acute inflammation, which is a short-term response to injury or infection, chronic inflammation can contribute to a wide range of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.
