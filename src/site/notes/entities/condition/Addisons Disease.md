# Addisons Disease

## Overview

Addison's Disease (Primary Adrenal Insufficiency) occurs when the adrenal cortex is damaged. Most cases in developed nations are **Autoimmune**. Without treatment, it can lead to a life-threatening **Adrenal Crisis**, characterized by shock and organ failure.

## Clinical Indicators

- **Hyperpigmentation:** Due to excess ACTH cross-reacting with melanocyte receptors.
- **Electrolyte Abnormalities:** Low sodium and high potassium.
