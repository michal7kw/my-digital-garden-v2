# Sarcopenia

## Overview

Sarcopenia is more than just natural muscle loss; it is a clinical syndrome that increases frailty and mortality risk in the elderly. It is defined by low muscle mass combined with either low muscle strength or low physical performance. It is a key target for longevity interventions.

## Management

- **Resistance Training:** The most effective treatment for building muscle mass.
- **High Protein Diet:** 1.2 - 1.5 g/kg/day recommended for seniors.
- **Vitamin D Optimization.**
