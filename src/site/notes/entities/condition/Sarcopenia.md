# Sarcopenia

## Overview
A progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder characterized by the loss of muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, often associated with aging.

## Clinical Presentation
### Symptoms
- Decreased muscle mass
- Reduced muscle strength
- Slow walking speed
- Difficulty with activities of daily living
- Frequent falls

## Diagnostic Information
### Diagnostic Criteria
```yaml
- Low muscle strength (grip strength or chair stand test)
- Low muscle quantity or quality (DXA or BIA)
- Low physical performance (Gait speed or SPPB)
```

## Risk Factors
- Aging
- Physical inactivity
- Inadequate protein intake
- Chronic inflammation (Inflamm-aging)
- Hormonal decline (Testosterone, Growth Hormone)

## Management
### Prevention
- Resistance training
- High-protein diet (1.2-1.5g/kg)
- Vitamin D optimization

### Treatment Approaches
- Progressive resistance exercise
- Creatine monohydrate supplementation
- Protein pulse feeding
