# Duodenal Ulcer

## Overview

A Duodenal Ulcer is a type of **Peptic Ulcer Disease** affecting the lining of the duodenum. Unlike gastric ulcers, pain from a duodenal ulcer often improves with eating or antacids and worsens 2-3 hours after meals or at night. The most common cause is infection with the bacterium *Helicobacter pylori*.

## Causes

1.  **H. pylori Infection:** Damages the mucous coating protecting the intestine.
2.  **NSAIDs:** Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs blocks enzymes that produce protective mucus.
3.  **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:** Rare condition causing excess acid production.
