# Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma

## Overview

Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) is a group of lung cancers that behave similarly, distinguished from small cell lung cancer (SCLC) by cell size and growth rate. It is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide but has better survival rates than SCLC if detected early.

## Types

1.  **Adenocarcinoma:** Starts in mucus-producing cells, usually in the outer parts of the lung. Most common type in non-smokers.
2.  **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Starts in squamous cells lining the airways, usually in the central part of the lung. Strongly linked to smoking.
3.  **Large Cell Carcinoma:** Can appear in any part of the lung and tends to grow and spread quickly.
