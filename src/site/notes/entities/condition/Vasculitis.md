# Vasculitis

## Overview

Vasculitis involves the immune system attacking blood vessel walls. This causes the walls to thicken and narrow, reducing the blood supply to organs. It can be categorized by the size of the vessels affected: **Large Vessel** (e.g., Giant Cell Arteritis), **Medium Vessel** (e.g., Kawasaki Disease), or **Small Vessel** (e.g., Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis).

## Key Types

- **Giant Cell Arteritis:** Affects large arteries in the head.
- **ANCA-Associated Vasculitis:** Affects small vessels in lungs/kidneys.
- **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis:** Linked to Hepatitis C; affects skin and kidneys.
- **IgA Vasculitis:** Common in children (Henoch-Schönlein purpura).
