# Pyelonephritis

## Overview

Pyelonephritis is an upper urinary tract infection. It most commonly results from bacteria (**Escherichia coli**) ascending from the bladder to the kidneys. Unlike simple cystitis, pyelonephritis carries a risk of permanent kidney scarring and life-threatening **Sepsis**.

## Complications

- **Kidney Scarring:** Leading to chronic kidney disease.
- **Renal Abscess:** Collection of pus in the kidney.
- **Sepsis:** Systemic inflammatory response.
- **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI).**
