# Cognitive Dysfunction

## Overview

Cognitive Dysfunction (or Cognitive Impairment) is a broad term describing a decline in mental abilities. It ranges from mild subjective complaints ("brain fog") to severe dementia. It is not a specific disease but a symptom or manifestation of various underlying pathologies, including neurodegeneration, vascular damage, metabolic imbalances, or psychiatric conditions.

## Etiology (Causes)

- **Neurodegenerative:** Alzheimer's, Parkinson's.
- **Vascular:** Stroke, small vessel disease.
- **Metabolic:** Hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency.
- **Psychiatric:** Major Depression ("Pseudodementia"), Anxiety.
- **Iatrogenic:** Side effects of medications (e.g., anticholinergics).
