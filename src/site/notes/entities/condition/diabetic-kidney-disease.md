# Diabetic Kidney Disease

## Overview

Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD), also known as **Diabetic Nephropathy**, is a serious complication of both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. It is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure worldwide. The earliest clinical sign is often **Microalbuminuria** (small amounts of protein in the urine).

## Pathophysiology

Chronic hyperglycemia leads to structural changes in the kidney, including basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion, eventually causing the filtration barrier to leak protein and the GFR to decline.
