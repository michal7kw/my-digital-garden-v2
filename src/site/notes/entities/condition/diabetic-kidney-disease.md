<h1>Diabetic Kidney Disease</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD), also known as <strong>Diabetic Nephropathy</strong>, is a serious complication of both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. It is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure worldwide. The earliest clinical sign is often <strong>Microalbuminuria</strong> (small amounts of protein in the urine).</p>
<h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
<p>Chronic hyperglycemia leads to structural changes in the kidney, including basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion, eventually causing the filtration barrier to leak protein and the GFR to decline.</p>
