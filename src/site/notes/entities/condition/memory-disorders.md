# Memory Disorders

## Overview

Memory Disorders affect the brain's ability to encode, store, or retrieve information. They range from mild, temporary forgetfulness to severe, progressive dementia. Memory loss can be specific (amnesia) or general.

## Common Types

- **Dementia:** An umbrella term for decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life (e.g., Alzheimer's, Vascular Dementia).
- **Amnesia:** Loss of memories, often due to brain injury or trauma.
- **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):** Problems with memory greater than normal for age but not severe enough to be dementia.
