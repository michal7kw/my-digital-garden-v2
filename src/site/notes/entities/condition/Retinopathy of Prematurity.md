# Retinopathy of Prematurity

## Overview

Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in the retina of premature infants. These vessels are fragile and can leak, causing scarring and pulling the retina away from the back of the eye (retinal detachment). It is a leading cause of childhood blindness.

## Pathophysiology

Normal retinal vessel growth stops at birth. In premature infants, the peripheral retina is avascular. High oxygen levels can suppress vessel growth factors (VEGF). When oxygen is lowered, the hypoxic retina overproduces VEGF, causing uncontrolled vessel growth.
