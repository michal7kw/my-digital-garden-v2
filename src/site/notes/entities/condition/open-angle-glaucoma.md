# Open-Angle Glaucoma

## Overview

Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is a progressive eye disease where the drainage angle formed by the cornea and iris remains open, but the trabecular meshwork is partially blocked. This causes fluid (aqueous humor) to drain too slowly, increasing eye pressure. This pressure gradually damages the optic nerve, leading to irreversible vision loss. It is often called the "silent thief of sight."

## Pathophysiology

The increased Intraocular Pressure (IOP) causes mechanical stress and ischemic injury to the retinal ganglion cell axons at the optic nerve head (optic disc), leading to cell death and cupping of the optic disc.
