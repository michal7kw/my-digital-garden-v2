# Hashimotos Thyroiditis

## Overview

Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (Chronic Lymphocytic Thyroiditis) is the leading cause of **Hypothyroidism** in developed countries. It is characterized by thyroid inflammation and the presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (**TPO**) or thyroglobulin.

## Pathophysiology

Infiltration of the thyroid gland by lymphocytes leading to follicular destruction and fibrosis. This gradually reduces the gland's ability to produce thyroid hormones.
