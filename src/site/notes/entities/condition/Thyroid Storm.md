# Thyroid Storm

## Overview

Thyroid Storm (Thyrotoxic Crisis) is the extreme end of the **Hyperthyroidism** spectrum. It is triggered by an acute stressor in a patient with underlying thyroid overactivity. Without rapid treatment, it progresses to multi-organ failure and death.

## Management

- **Antithyroid Drugs:** High-dose Propylthiouracil (PTU) or Methimazole.
- **Beta-blockers:** Propranolol to control heart rate and tremors.
- **Iodine Solutions:** To block hormone release.
- **Corticosteroids:** To block peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.
