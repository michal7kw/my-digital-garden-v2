# Osteoporosis

## Overview

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder. It occurs when bone resorption (breakdown) exceeds bone formation. Bones become porous and brittle, such that even a minor fall or mild stresses like coughing can cause a fracture.

## Complications

- **Spinal Compression Fractures.**
- **Hip Fractures:** Associated with high morbidity and mortality in the elderly.
- **Kyphosis:** Forward hunching of the spine.
