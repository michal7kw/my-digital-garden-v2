# Frontotemporal Dementia

## Overview
Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is the second most common cause of dementia in individuals under age 65. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, FTD primarily affects behavior, personality, and language rather than memory in early stages. It encompasses several clinical syndromes with overlapping pathologies.

## Clinical Variants
1. **Behavioral Variant FTD (bvFTD)**: Personality changes, disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy
2. **Semantic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA)**: Loss of word meaning and object knowledge
3. **Nonfluent Variant PPA (nfvPPA)**: Effortful, agrammatic speech production
4. **FTD with Motor Neuron Disease**: FTD combined with ALS features

## Pathological Subtypes
1. **FTLD-Tau**: Tau protein aggregation (Pick bodies, CBD, PSP)
2. **FTLD-TDP**: TDP-43 protein inclusions (most common)
3. **FTLD-FUS**: FUS protein inclusions (rare)

## Genetic Causes (~30-50% familial)
- **C9orf72**: Most common genetic cause; hexanucleotide repeat expansion
- **MAPT**: Tau gene mutations
- **GRN**: Progranulin gene mutations

## Key Features by Variant

### Behavioral Variant
- Early behavioral disinhibition
- Early apathy or inertia
- Early loss of sympathy or empathy
- Early perseverative or compulsive behavior
- Hyperorality and dietary changes
- Executive dysfunction with relative sparing of memory

### Differentiation from Alzheimer's
- Younger onset (45-65 years typical)
- Preserved episodic memory early
- Prominent behavioral/personality changes
- Different biomarker profile
