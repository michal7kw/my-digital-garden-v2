# Malnutrition and Malabsorption

## Overview

While related, these conditions have different roots. **Malnutrition** refers to an imbalance of nutrients (too little or too much), while **Malabsorption** specifically refers to the gut's failure to absorb nutrients despite adequate intake. Together, they lead to profound systemic decline and multiple vitamin/mineral deficiencies.

## Common Causes of Malabsorption

- **Celiac Disease:** Gluten-induced damage to the small intestine.
- **Pancreatic Insufficiency:** Lack of digestive enzymes.
- **Biliary Obstruction:** Lack of bile for fat absorption.
- **Short Bowel Syndrome:** Surgical removal of intestine.
