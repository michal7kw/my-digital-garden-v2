# HIV Infections

## Overview

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) targets the immune system by destroying CD4 T cells (helper T cells), which help the body fight infection. Without treatment (Antiretroviral Therapy or ART), HIV can gradually destroy the immune system and advance to **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)**.

## Pathogenesis

HIV is a retrovirus that integrates its genetic material into the DNA of the host cell. It replicates primarily in CD4+ T cells, leading to their depletion and severe immunodeficiency.
