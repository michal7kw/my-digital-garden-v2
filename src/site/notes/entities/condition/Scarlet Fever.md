# Scarlet Fever

## Overview

Scarlet Fever (Scarlatina) is caused by the same bacteria that cause strep throat (*Streptococcus pyogenes*). The bacteria release a toxin that results in the characteristic red rash and tongue changes. While once a serious childhood disease, it is now easily treatable with antibiotics.

## Complications

- **Rheumatic Fever.**
- **Post-streptococcal Glomerulonephritis** (Kidney inflammation).
- **Otitis Media** (Ear infection).
- **Peritonsillar Abscess.**
