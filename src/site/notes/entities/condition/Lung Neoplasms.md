# Lung Neoplasms

## Overview

Lung Neoplasms refer to tumors of the lung. While benign tumors exist (e.g., hamartomas), the term is most often used to describe **Lung Cancer** (Bronchogenic Carcinoma). Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.

## Types

1.  **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** 85% of cases. Includes Adenocarcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Large Cell Carcinoma.
2.  **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):** 15% of cases. Highly aggressive, strongly associated with smoking, spreads early.
3.  **Lung Carcinoid Tumors:** Slower growing neuroendocrine tumors.
