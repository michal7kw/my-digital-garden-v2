# Diabetic Foot

## Overview

Diabetic Foot Syndrome is a major complication of diabetes mellitus. It stems from the combination of **peripheral neuropathy** (loss of sensation) and **peripheral artery disease** (poor circulation). The loss of protective sensation means minor injuries go unnoticed, while poor blood flow prevents healing, leading to chronic ulcers and potentially amputation.

## Pathogenesis

1.  **Neuropathy:** Sensory (loss of pain), Motor (muscle atrophy/deformity), Autonomic (dry skin).
2.  **Ischemia:** Reduced blood flow.
3.  **Infection:** Bacteria enter open wounds.
