# Squamous Cell Carcinoma

## Overview

Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer. It develops in the squamous cells that make up the middle and outer layers of the skin. While usually not life-threatening, it can be aggressive and spread if untreated. SCC can also occur in the lungs, esophagus, and head/neck.
