- **Cardiovascular:** Heart attack, arrhythmia, stroke, sudden cardiac death.
- **Neurological:** Seizures, headaches, cognitive impairment.
- **Psychiatric:** Anxiety, paranoia, psychosis ("cocaine bugs"), depression.
- **Respiratory:** "Crack lung" (if smoked), nasal septum perforation (if snorted).
