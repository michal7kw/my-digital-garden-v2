# Eye Diseases

## Overview

Eye Diseases encompass a wide range of conditions that impair vision or affect the structures of the eye. Major global causes of vision impairment include refractive errors, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Early detection through regular eye exams is often critical for preserving sight.

## Common Types

- **Refractive Errors:** Myopia (nearsightedness), Hyperopia (farsightedness), Astigmatism, Presbyopia.
- **Cataracts:** Clouding of the lens.
- **Glaucoma:** Damage to the optic nerve, often from high pressure.
- **Retinal Disorders:** Macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment.
- **Infections/Inflammation:** Conjunctivitis, Uveitis, Keratitis.
