# Peripheral Neuropathy

## Overview

Peripheral Neuropathy indicates that the nerves carrying signals to and from the central nervous system are damaged. This can affect sensory nerves (pain/temp), motor nerves (muscle control), or autonomic nerves (organ function). It is most commonly a complication of **Diabetes**.

## Common Causes

- **Diabetic Neuropathy:** High blood sugar damages nerve fibers.
- **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:** Essential for the myelin sheath.
- **Alcoholic Neuropathy:** Direct toxic effect of alcohol and associated malnutrition.
- **Toxic Neuropathy:** Side effect of certain medications or heavy metals.
