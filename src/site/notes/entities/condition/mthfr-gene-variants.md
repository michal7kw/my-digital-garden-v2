<h1>MTHFR Gene Variants</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The MTHFR gene provides instructions for making the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme. This enzyme is crucial for converting folate into its active form (<strong>5-MTHF</strong>). Variants in this gene can reduce enzyme efficiency, potentially leading to high levels of <strong>Homocysteine</strong>, which is a risk factor for vascular damage and pregnancy complications.</p>
<h2>Key Variants</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>C677T:</strong> Most common; has the greatest impact on enzyme activity. Homozygous (TT) can reduce activity by up to 70%.</li>
<li><strong>A1298C:</strong> Lesser impact on enzyme activity but significant if combined with C677T.</li>
</ul>
