# Urinary Tract Obstruction

## Overview

Urinary Tract Obstruction (Obstructive Uropathy) can occur anywhere from the renal pelvis to the urethra. It causes increased pressure upstream, which can lead to **Hydronephrosis** (swelling of the kidney) and permanent renal failure if not relieved promptly.

## Potential Causes

- **Lower Tract:** BPH (most common in men), Bladder stones, Urethral strictures.
- **Upper Tract:** Kidney stones, Ureteral tumors, retroperitoneal fibrosis.
