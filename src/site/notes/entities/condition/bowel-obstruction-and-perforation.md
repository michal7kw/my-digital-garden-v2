# Bowel Obstruction and Perforation

## Overview

Intestinal obstruction prevents the normal passage of digestive contents. If the pressure becomes too high or the blood supply is cut off (**Strangulation**), the bowel wall can die and rupture, leading to **Perforation**. Perforation allows intestinal contents to leak into the abdominal cavity, causing life-threatening **Peritonitis** and **Sepsis**.

## Key Concepts

- **Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO):** Most common; often due to adhesions.
- **Large Bowel Obstruction (LBO):** Often due to tumors or volvulus.
- **Perforation:** A surgical emergency requiring immediate repair and washout.
