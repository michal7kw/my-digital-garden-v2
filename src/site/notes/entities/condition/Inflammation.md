# Inflammation

## Overview

Inflammation is a vital part of the immune system's response to injury and infection. It is the body's way of signaling the immune system to heal and repair damaged tissue, as well as defend itself against foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria. However, **Chronic Inflammation** persists over time and contributes to many major disease states.

## Types

1.  **Acute:** Rapid onset, short duration.
2.  **Chronic:** Slow onset, long duration.
