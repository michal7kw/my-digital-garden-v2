# Chronic Lung Disease

## Overview

Chronic Lung Disease (CLD) encompasses disorders such as **COPD**, **Asthma**, **Pulmonary Fibrosis**, and **Bronchiectasis**. These conditions lead to persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation or impaired gas exchange.

## Categories

- **Obstructive:** Difficulty exhaling (COPD, Asthma).
- **Restrictive:** Difficulty expanding lungs (Pulmonary Fibrosis, Sarcoidosis).
- **Vascular:** Affecting blood vessels (Pulmonary Hypertension).
