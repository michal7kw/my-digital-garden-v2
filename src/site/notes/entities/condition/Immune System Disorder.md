# Immune System Disorder

## Overview

The immune system protects the body from pathogens. Disorders occur when this system fails to work correctly. **Immunodeficiency** leaves the body vulnerable to infections, while **Immune Dysfunction** (including Autoimmunity and Allergies) results in the system attacking healthy tissue or overreacting to harmless substances.

## Main Categories

- **Primary Immunodeficiency:** Inherited genetic defects.
- **Secondary Immunodeficiency:** Acquired due to infection (HIV), medication, or aging.
- **Autoimmune Disease:** Immune system attacks "self" (Lupus, RA, Hashimoto's).
- **Hypersensitivity:** Overreaction to allergens (Asthma, Hay fever).
