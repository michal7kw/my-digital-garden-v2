# Bone Marrow Disorder

## Overview

Bone Marrow Disorders involve the replacement of healthy marrow with abnormal or cancerous cells, or the failure of the marrow to produce cells entirely. These conditions result in **Cytopenia** (low blood counts) and can be life-threatening.

## Types

- **Leukemia:** Cancer of white blood cells.
- **Aplastic Anemia:** Marrow stops producing all cells.
- **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):** "Pre-leukemia"; abnormal cell production.
- **Multiple Myeloma:** Cancer of plasma cells.
- **Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN):** Overproduction of cells.
