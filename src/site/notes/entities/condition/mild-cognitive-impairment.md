# Mild Cognitive Impairment

## Overview
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a clinical syndrome characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected for age but not severe enough to meet criteria for dementia. It represents a critical window for early intervention and prevention strategies.

## Subtypes
1. **Amnestic MCI (aMCI)**: Primarily memory impairment; higher risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease
2. **Non-Amnestic MCI**: Impairment in other cognitive domains (attention, language, visuospatial); may progress to other dementias

## Diagnostic Criteria (NIA-AA)
1. Concern about cognitive change from patient, informant, or clinician
2. Objective evidence of impairment in one or more cognitive domains
3. Preservation of independence in functional abilities
4. Not demented

## Progression Rates
- **10-15%** annual conversion to dementia (vs. 1-2% in normal aging)
- **~30-40%** remain stable over 5 years
- **~15-20%** may revert to normal cognition

## Risk Factors
- Age (primary risk factor)
- APOE ε4 allele
- Cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia)
- Low education/cognitive reserve
- Depression
- Sleep disorders
