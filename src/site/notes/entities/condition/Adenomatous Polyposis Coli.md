# Adenomatous Polyposis Coli

## Overview

Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, more commonly known as **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)**, is a rare genetic condition. It is caused by a defect in the *APC* tumor suppressor gene. Without treatment (usually surgical removal of the colon), colorectal cancer develops in nearly 100% of patients, often before age 40.

## Pathophysiology

The *APC* gene normally helps control how often a cell divides. Mutations lead to uncontrolled cell growth and polyp formation.
