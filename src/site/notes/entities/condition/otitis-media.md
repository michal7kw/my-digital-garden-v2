# Otitis Media

## Overview

Otitis Media is an infection of the middle ear, the air-filled space behind the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear. Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections. It often results from a malfunctioning eustachian tube that traps fluid.

## Types

1.  **Acute Otitis Media (AOM):** Active infection with pain and fever.
2.  **Otitis Media with Effusion (OME):** Fluid remains after infection clears.
3.  **Chronic Otitis Media:** Persistent infection/fluid, can damage the ear.
