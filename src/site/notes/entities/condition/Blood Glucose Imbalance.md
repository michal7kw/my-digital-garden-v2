# Blood Glucose Imbalance

## Overview

Blood Glucose Imbalance refers to deviations from the normal range of blood sugar (typically 70–99 mg/dL fasting). **Hyperglycemia** is a hallmark of diabetes and can lead to long-term organ damage. **Hypoglycemia** is an acute medical emergency that can lead to seizures and loss of consciousness.

## Clinical States

- **Hyperglycemia:** High blood sugar; caused by insulin resistance or deficiency.
- **Hypoglycemia:** Low blood sugar; often a complication of diabetes treatment or rare tumors (Insulinoma).
