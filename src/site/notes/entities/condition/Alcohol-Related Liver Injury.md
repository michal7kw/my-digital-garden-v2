# Alcohol-Related Liver Injury

## Overview

Alcohol-Related Liver Injury (ARLI) includes several stages of liver damage caused by alcohol. It typically begins with **Steatosis** (fatty liver), progresses to **Alcoholic Hepatitis** (inflammation), and finally leads to **Cirrhosis** (permanent scarring).

## Stages

1.  **Alcoholic Fatty Liver:** Accumulation of fat in liver cells.
2.  **Alcoholic Hepatitis:** Acute inflammation and cell death.
3.  **Cirrhosis:** Replacement of liver tissue with fibrotic scar tissue.
