# Cervical Cancer

## Overview

Cervical Cancer starts in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus. Most cases are caused by the **Human Papillomavirus (HPV)**. It is one of the most preventable and treatable cancers if detected early through regular screening (Pap smears/HPV tests) and vaccination.

## Pathophysiology

High-risk HPV types (especially 16 and 18) produce oncoproteins (E6 and E7) that interfere with tumor suppressor proteins (p53 and pRb), leading to uncontrolled cell division and malignant transformation.
