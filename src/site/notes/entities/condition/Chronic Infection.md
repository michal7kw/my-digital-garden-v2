# Chronic Infection

## Overview

Chronic infections occur when the immune system is unable to fully clear a pathogen (virus, bacteria, or parasite). These infections can be relatively asymptomatic for years while causing slow damage to tissues. Common examples include **Hepatitis C**, **Tuberculosis**, and **Infective Endocarditis**.

## Key Examples

- **Hepatitis C:** Viral infection affecting the liver.
- **Tuberculosis (Latent/Active):** Bacterial infection primarily in the lungs.
- **Endocarditis (Subacute):** Bacterial infection of heart valves.
- **HIV/AIDS.**
