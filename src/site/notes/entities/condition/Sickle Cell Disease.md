# Sickle Cell Disease

## Overview

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) results from a single point mutation in the beta-globin gene. This causes hemoglobin to polymerize under low-oxygen conditions, deforming red blood cells into a "sickle" shape. These cells are fragile (causing **Anemia**) and block small blood vessels (causing **Vaso-occlusive Crisis**).

## Complications

- **Acute Chest Syndrome:** Life-threatening lung complication.
- **Stroke.**
- **Splenic Sequestration:** Sudden pooling of blood in the spleen.
- **Organ Damage:** Kidneys, liver, and bones (Avascular necrosis).
