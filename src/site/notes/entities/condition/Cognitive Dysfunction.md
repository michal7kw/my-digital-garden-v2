Cognitive Dysfunction (or Cognitive Impairment) is a broad term describing a decline in mental abilities. It ranges from mild subjective complaints ("brain fog") to severe dementia. It is not a specific disease but a symptom or manifestation of various underlying pathologies, including neurodegeneration, vascular damage, metabolic imbalances, or psychiatric conditions.
