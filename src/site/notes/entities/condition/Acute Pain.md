# Acute Pain

## Overview

Acute pain is a normal physiological response to an adverse chemical, thermal, or mechanical stimulus. It is self-limiting and resolves when the underlying cause is treated or healed. Unlike chronic pain, it serves a protective biological function by warning of injury.

## Pathophysiology

It involves **nociception**, where specialized nerve endings (nociceptors) detect noxious stimuli and transmit signals via A-delta and C fibers to the spinal cord and brain.
