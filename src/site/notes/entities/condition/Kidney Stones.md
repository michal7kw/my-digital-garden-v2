# Kidney Stones

## Overview

Kidney Stones (Renal Calculi) are solid masses formed from crystals that precipitate out of the urine. They can be very small or grow large enough to obstruct the ureter. Small stones can pass on their own, but larger ones require medical intervention such as lithotripsy or surgery.

## Types of Stones

- **Calcium Oxalate:** Most common (80%); often dietary.
- **Uric Acid:** Linked to gout and high-protein diets.
- **Struvite:** Result from chronic UTIs.
- **Cystine:** Rare genetic cause.
