# Orthostatic Hypotension

## Overview

Orthostatic Hypotension (Postural Hypotension) is defined as a systolic blood pressure drop of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic drop of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing. It results from the body's failure to compensate quickly for the gravitational pooling of blood in the legs.

## Causes

- **Hypovolemia:** Dehydration, blood loss.
- **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Diabetes, Parkinson's (neurogenic OH).
- **Medication:** Side effects of antihypertensives.
- **Cardiac:** Heart failure, arrhythmias.
