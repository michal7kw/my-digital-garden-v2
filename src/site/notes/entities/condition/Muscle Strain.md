# Muscle Strain

## Overview

Muscle Strain (pulled muscle) occurs when muscle fibers are torn. It is common in athletes and during heavy lifting. Severity is graded from 1 (mild stretch) to 3 (complete rupture). Proper recovery is essential to prevent permanent scarring and recurring injury.

## Severity Grades

- **Grade 1:** Mild damage; minimal loss of strength.
- **Grade 2:** More extensive fiber damage; significant pain and swelling.
- **Grade 3:** Complete tear; loss of muscle function.
