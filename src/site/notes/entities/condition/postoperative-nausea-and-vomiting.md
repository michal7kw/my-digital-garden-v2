# Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting

## Overview

Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) is one of the most common and distressing complications of surgery and anesthesia. It affects about 30% of surgical patients but can be as high as 80% in high-risk groups. It can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and wound dehiscence (surgical cut opening).

## Prevention

Risk is assessed using the **Apfel Score**:
1.  Female gender.
2.  Non-smoker.
3.  History of PONV/motion sickness.
4.  Postoperative opioids.
