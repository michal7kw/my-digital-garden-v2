# B Vitamin Deficiency

## Overview

B vitamins are a group of eight water-soluble vitamins that play critical roles in cellular functioning. Deficiencies in **Folate (B9)**, **B6**, and **B12** are clinically significant, often leading to **Megaloblastic Anemia** and various neurological deficits.

## Key Deficiencies

- **Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin):** Essential for nerve health and RBCs. Deficiency causes pernicious anemia and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.
- **Folate (B9):** Critical for DNA synthesis. Deficiency during pregnancy causes neural tube defects.
- **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Involved in neurotransmitter synthesis. Deficiency causes dermatitis and microcytic anemia.
