# Venous Thromboembolism

## Overview

Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and potentially fatal condition. It consists of two related conditions:
1.  **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):** A clot in a deep vein, usually the leg.
2.  **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** Occurs when a DVT clot breaks free and travels to the lungs, blocking blood flow.
