# Acne Vulgaris

## Overview

Acne Vulgaris is the most common skin disease worldwide, primarily affecting adolescents but often persisting into adulthood. It occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil (sebum) and dead skin cells, often leading to the growth of bacteria (*Cutibacterium acnes*) and subsequent inflammation.

## Pathogenesis

Four key factors are involved in the development of acne:
1. **Follicular hyperkeratinization:** Clogging of the pore.
2. **Increased sebum production:** Often driven by androgens.
3. **Bacterial colonization:** Overgrowth of *C. acnes*.
4. **Inflammation:** Immune response to bacteria and follicle rupture.
