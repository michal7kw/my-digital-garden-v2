# Atrial Fibrillation

## Overview

Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is characterized by chaotic electrical activity in the atria, causing them to quiver rather than contract effectively. This leads to an irregular and often rapid heart rate. The primary clinical danger of AFib is the formation of blood clots in the heart, which can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.

## Classification

- **Paroxysmal:** Stops on its own or with intervention within 7 days.
- **Persistent:** Lasts longer than 7 days.
- **Long-standing Persistent:** Lasts longer than 12 months.
- **Permanent:** When the patient and clinician decide to stop rhythm control efforts.
