# Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease

## Overview

Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), recently renamed **Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)**, is the accumulation of excess fat in the liver. It is the most common chronic liver disease globally. It ranges from simple fatty liver (steatosis) to **Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)**, which involves inflammation and liver cell damage, potentially progressing to cirrhosis and liver failure.

## Pathophysiology

It is closely linked to **insulin resistance** and metabolic syndrome. Excess free fatty acids and carbohydrates are converted to triglycerides in the liver.
