# Rheumatic Diseases

## Overview

Rheumatic diseases (Rheumatism) affect the joints, tendons, ligaments, bones, and muscles. Many are **autoimmune** in nature, where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. They are typically chronic and can lead to significant disability if untreated.

## Common Types

- **Osteoarthritis:** Degenerative joint disease.
- **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Autoimmune joint inflammation.
- **Lupus (SLE):** Systemic autoimmune disease.
- **Gout:** Metabolic arthritis (uric acid).
- **Ankylosing Spondylitis:** Inflammatory spine disease.
