<h1>Peripheral Arterial Disease</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is caused by <strong>atherosclerosis</strong> (hardening of the arteries). Plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to the head, organs, and limbs. When plaque hardens, it narrows the arteries and limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body. It most commonly affects the legs, causing pain during walking (claudication) that resolves with rest.</p>
