# Rhabdomyolysis

## Overview

Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by the necrosis of muscle fibers. The release of intracellular contents, especially **Myoglobin**, is highly toxic to the kidneys and can lead to **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of treatment.

## Complications

- **Acute Kidney Injury:** Due to myoglobin-induced tubular damage.
- **Electrolyte Imbalance:** Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia.
- **Compartment Syndrome.**
- **DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation).**
