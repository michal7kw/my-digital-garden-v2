# Gouty Arthritis

## Overview

Gouty Arthritis (Gout) is a metabolic disorder where high levels of **uric acid** (hyperuricemia) lead to the formation of needle-like urate crystals in and around joints. These crystals trigger an intense inflammatory response. The classic presentation is "podagra"—acute inflammation of the base of the big toe—but it can affect ankles, knees, elbows, wrists, and fingers.

## Mechanism

Uric acid is a breakdown product of **purines**. In gout, either the body produces too much uric acid or the kidneys excrete too little. When concentrations exceed the saturation point, crystallization occurs.
