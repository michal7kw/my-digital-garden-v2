# Neurogenic Bladder

## Overview

Neurogenic Bladder occurs when the nerves that carry messages between the bladder and the brain/spinal cord are damaged. This can cause the bladder to become overactive (spastic) or underactive (flaccid). Proper management is critical to prevent permanent **Kidney Damage**.

## Complications

- **Hydronephrosis:** Urine backup into kidneys.
- **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs).**
- **Vesicoureteral Reflux.**
