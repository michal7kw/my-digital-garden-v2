# Acute Lung Injury

## Overview

Acute Lung Injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute respiratory failure characterized by the rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. It involves the disruption of the lung's endothelial and epithelial barriers, leading to increased vascular permeability and fluid leakage into the alveoli (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). This impairs gas exchange, resulting in severe hypoxemia.

Historically, ALI was defined as a milder form of **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)**. Under the 2012 Berlin Definition, the term "Acute Lung Injury" was largely replaced by categorizing ARDS into mild, moderate, and severe stages based on the degree of hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio). However, the term ALI is still frequently used in research and general clinical descriptions.

## Clinical Presentation

Symptoms typically develop within hours to days of an inciting event (such as infection or trauma). Key features include:
- **Dyspnea:** Severe shortness of breath.
- **Hypoxemia:** Low blood oxygen levels often requiring mechanical ventilation.
- **Tachypnea:** Rapid, labored breathing.
- **Cyanosis:** Bluish discoloration of skin/lips.

## Causes

ALI is triggered by direct or indirect injury to the lung:

**Direct Lung Injury:**
- Pneumonia (bacterial, viral, fungal)
- Aspiration of gastric contents
- Pulmonary contusion
- Inhalation injury (smoke, toxins)

**Indirect Lung Injury:**
- Sepsis (most common cause)
- Severe trauma with shock
- Acute pancreatitis
- Drug overdose
