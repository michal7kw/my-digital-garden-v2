# Urinary Concentration Imbalance

## Overview

Urinary concentration is measured by **Specific Gravity** and **Osmolality**. The kidneys' ability to concentrate urine is a key indicator of renal tubular function and overall hydration status. Imbalances often point to hormonal issues (ADH) or structural kidney damage.

## Clinical Indicators

- **High Specific Gravity (>1.030):** Indicates concentrated urine; seen in dehydration, SIADH, and glycosuria.
- **Low Specific Gravity (<1.005):** Indicates dilute urine; seen in excessive fluid intake, Diabetes Insipidus, and advanced kidney failure.
