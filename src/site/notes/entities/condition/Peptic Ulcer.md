# Peptic Ulcer

## Overview

Peptic ulcers are open sores that develop on the inside lining of the stomach (**Gastric Ulcer**) and the upper portion of the small intestine (**Duodenal Ulcer**). The most common causes are infection with the bacterium *Helicobacter pylori* (*H. pylori*) and long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Stress and spicy foods do not cause peptic ulcers but can make symptoms worse.
