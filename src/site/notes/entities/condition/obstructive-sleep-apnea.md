# Obstructive Sleep Apnea

## Overview

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. It causes oxygen levels in the blood to drop, triggering the brain to wake you up briefly to reopen the airway. This cycle prevents deep, restorative sleep.

## Complications

- **Cardiovascular:** Hypertension, Heart Attack, Stroke, Arrhythmias (Atrial Fibrillation).
- **Metabolic:** Type 2 Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome.
- **Daytime Fatigue:** Increased risk of accidents.
