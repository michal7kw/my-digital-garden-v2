# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

## Overview

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. It includes **Emphysema** (damage to air sacs) and **Chronic Bronchitis** (inflammation of the lining of bronchial tubes). It is a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse over time.
