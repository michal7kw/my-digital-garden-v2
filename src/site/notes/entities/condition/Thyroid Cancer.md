# Thyroid Cancer

## Overview

Thyroid Cancer originates in the follicular or parafollicular cells of the thyroid. **Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC)** is the most common type (80-85%) and has an excellent prognosis. Other types include Follicular, Medullary, and the highly aggressive Anaplastic carcinoma.

## Key Types

- **Papillary:** Slow-growing, excellent survival rate.
- **Follicular:** Also generally favorable prognosis.
- **Medullary:** Arises from C-cells (calcitonin-producing); often genetic.
- **Anaplastic:** Rare, very aggressive, and difficult to treat.
