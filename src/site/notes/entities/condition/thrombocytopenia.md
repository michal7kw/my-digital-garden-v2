<h1>Thrombocytopenia</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Thrombocytopenia occurs when the platelet count falls below the normal range (typically 150,000 to 450,000 per microliter). Platelets are essential for blood clotting. A low count increases the risk of spontaneous bleeding, which can be internal and life-threatening if the count is very low (&lt;10,000-20,000).</p>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decreased Production:</strong> Bone marrow failure, nutritional deficiencies (B12/Folate).</li>
<li><strong>Increased Destruction:</strong> Autoimmune (ITP), drug-induced, or consumption (DIC/TTP).</li>
<li><strong>Sequestration:</strong> Enlarged spleen (Hypersplenism).</li>
</ul>
