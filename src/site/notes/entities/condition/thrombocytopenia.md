# Thrombocytopenia

## Overview

Thrombocytopenia occurs when the platelet count falls below the normal range (typically 150,000 to 450,000 per microliter). Platelets are essential for blood clotting. A low count increases the risk of spontaneous bleeding, which can be internal and life-threatening if the count is very low (<10,000-20,000).

## Causes

- **Decreased Production:** Bone marrow failure, nutritional deficiencies (B12/Folate).
- **Increased Destruction:** Autoimmune (ITP), drug-induced, or consumption (DIC/TTP).
- **Sequestration:** Enlarged spleen (Hypersplenism).
