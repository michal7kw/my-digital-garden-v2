# Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

## Overview

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) most commonly results from a deficiency of the enzyme **21-hydroxylase**. Because the body cannot make cortisol, the pituitary overproduces ACTH to stimulate the adrenals, causing them to enlarge (hyperplasia) and shunt precursors into the **Androgen** pathway.

## Types

- **Classic (Salt-wasting):** Most severe; life-threatening aldosterone deficiency.
- **Classic (Simple Virilizing):** Moderate; primarily affects sexual development.
- **Non-classic:** Milder; often appears in adolescence with acne or irregular periods.
