# Vascular Dementia

## Overview
Vascular Dementia (VaD) results from cerebrovascular pathology that disrupts brain function. It encompasses a spectrum from strategic single strokes to diffuse small vessel disease. Unlike the gradual decline of Alzheimer's disease, VaD often presents with stepwise deterioration following vascular events.

## Subtypes
1. **Multi-Infarct Dementia**: Multiple large vessel strokes
2. **Small Vessel Disease (SVD)**: White matter lesions, lacunar infarcts
3. **Strategic Single-Infarct Dementia**: Critical location (thalamus, hippocampus)
4. **Hypoperfusion Dementia**: Cardiac arrest, severe hypotension
5. **Hemorrhagic Dementia**: Post-hemorrhage cognitive decline

## Clinical Features
- **Executive Dysfunction**: Prominent early (planning, organization)
- **Processing Speed**: Significantly slowed
- **Attention**: Impaired concentration
- **Memory**: Variable; retrieval often worse than encoding
- **Gait Disturbance**: Small-stepped, magnetic gait
- **Urinary Symptoms**: Urgency, incontinence
- **Mood Changes**: Depression, emotional lability

## Vascular Risk Factors
- Hypertension (most important modifiable factor)
- Diabetes mellitus
- Atrial fibrillation
- Hyperlipidemia
- Smoking
- Obesity
- Physical inactivity

## Neuroimaging Findings
- White matter hyperintensities (leukoaraiosis)
- Lacunar infarcts
- Cortical/subcortical infarcts
- Microbleeds (on susceptibility-weighted imaging)
- Brain atrophy
