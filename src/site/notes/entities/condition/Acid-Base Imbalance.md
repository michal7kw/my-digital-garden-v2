# Acid-Base Imbalance

## Overview

The body maintain a strict pH range. Imbalances are classified based on the cause: **Respiratory** (CO2 related) or **Metabolic** (Bicarbonate related). **Metabolic Acidosis** involves an excess of acid or loss of base, while **Metabolic Alkalosis** involve an excess of base or loss of acid.

## Types

- **Metabolic Acidosis:** Caused by kidney failure, DKA, or lactic acidosis.
- **Metabolic Alkalosis:** Caused by excessive vomiting or diuretic use.
- **Respiratory Acidosis/Alkalosis:** Caused by lung dysfunction affecting CO2 levels.
