# Ketosis

## Overview

Ketosis is a natural metabolic process. When the body doesn't have enough glucose for energy, it burns stored fats instead; this results in a build-up of acids called **Ketones** within the body. While nutritional ketosis is often sought for weight loss and blood sugar control, it must be distinguished from **Ketoacidosis**, a dangerous medical emergency.

## Clinical Applications

- **Weight Loss:** Effective for fat reduction.
- **Diabetes Management:** Improves insulin sensitivity.
- **Epilepsy:** Therapeutic for drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy.
