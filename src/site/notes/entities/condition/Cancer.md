# Cancer

## Overview

Cancer is a group of more than 100 diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. If the spread is not controlled, it can result in death. Cancer is caused by both external factors (tobacco, infectious organisms, chemicals, and radiation) and internal factors (inherited mutations, hormones, immune conditions, and mutations that occur from metabolism). These causative factors may act together or in sequence to initiate or promote carcinogenesis.

The Hallmark of cancer is **metastasis**, the process by which cancer cells spread to distant parts of the body through the lymph system or bloodstream.

## Main Classifications

- **Carcinoma:** Begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs.
- **Sarcoma:** Begins in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue.
- **Leukemia:** Starts in blood-forming tissue, such as the bone marrow, and causes large numbers of abnormal blood cells to be produced.
- **Lymphoma and Myeloma:** Begin in the cells of the immune system.
- **Central Nervous System Cancers:** Begin in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord.
