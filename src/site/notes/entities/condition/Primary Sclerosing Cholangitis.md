# Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

## Overview

Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) involves "onion-skin" scarring of the bile ducts. It is strongly associated with **Ulcerative Colitis**. PSC significantly increases the risk of **Cholangiocarcinoma** (bile duct cancer).

## Complications

- **Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma).**
- **Cirrhosis and Liver Failure.**
- **Recurrent Bacterial Cholangitis.**
- **Colorectal Cancer** (especially if IBD is present).
