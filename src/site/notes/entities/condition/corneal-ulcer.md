# Corneal Ulcer

## Overview

A corneal ulcer (keratitis) is an open sore on the clear front surface of the eye. It is considered a medical emergency because it can lead to permanent blindness if untreated. The most common cause is infection (bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic).

## Causes

- **Bacterial:** *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (common in contact lens wearers), *Staphylococcus aureus*.
- **Viral:** *Herpes Simplex Virus* (Ocular Herpes).
- **Fungal:** *Fusarium*, *Aspergillus*.
- **Parasitic:** *Acanthamoeba* (water/soil exposure).
