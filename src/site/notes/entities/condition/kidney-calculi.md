<h1>Kidney Calculi</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Kidney Calculi (Kidney Stones or Nephrolithiasis) form when urine becomes concentrated, allowing minerals to crystallize and stick together. They can range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. Passing stones can be incredibly painful, but they usually cause no permanent damage if recognized early.</p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Calcium Stones:</strong> (Most common) Usually Calcium Oxalate.</li>
<li><strong>Struvite Stones:</strong> Form in response to a urinary tract infection.</li>
<li><strong>Uric Acid Stones:</strong> Form in people who don't drink enough fluid or lose too much fluid, eat a high-protein diet, or have gout.</li>
<li><strong>Cystine Stones:</strong> Caused by a hereditary disorder (cystinuria).</li>
</ol>
