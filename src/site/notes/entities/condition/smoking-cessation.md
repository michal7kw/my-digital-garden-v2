# Smoking Cessation

## Overview

Smoking Cessation (Quitting Smoking) is the single most important step smokers can take to improve their health and life expectancy. It involves overcoming **Nicotine** addiction and breaking behavioral habits. Success rates are significantly higher with a combination of medication and counseling.

## Benefits Over Time

- **20 minutes:** Heart rate drops.
- **12 hours:** Carbon monoxide levels in blood return to normal.
- **2-12 weeks:** Circulation and lung function improve.
- **1-9 months:** Coughing and shortness of breath decrease.
- **1 year:** Risk of coronary heart disease is half that of a smoker.
