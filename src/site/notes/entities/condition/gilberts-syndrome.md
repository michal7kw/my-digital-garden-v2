# Gilberts Syndrome

## Overview

Gilbert's Syndrome is caused by a reduced activity of the enzyme **UGT1A1**, which conjugates bilirubin. This leads to elevated levels of **Unconjugated Bilirubin** in the blood. It is a benign condition and does not require treatment, but it is important to distinguish it from more serious liver diseases.

## Clinical Significance

Individuals with Gilbert's Syndrome may be more sensitive to certain drugs metabolized by the UGT pathway, such as the chemotherapy drug Irinotecan.
