# Pre-Eclampsia

## Overview

Pre-eclampsia typically begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Left untreated, it can lead to serious—even fatal—complications for both mother and baby, including **Eclampsia** (seizures). The only cure is delivery of the baby.

## Pathophysiology

It involves abnormal development of the placenta's blood vessels, leading to poor blood flow, placental ischemia, and release of factors that damage the mother's blood vessels (endothelial dysfunction).
