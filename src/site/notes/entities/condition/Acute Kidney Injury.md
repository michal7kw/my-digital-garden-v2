# Acute Kidney Injury

## Overview

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), previously known as acute renal failure, is a sudden and rapid decline in kidney function. This impairment prevents the kidneys from effectively filtering waste products from the blood and maintaining the proper balance of fluids and electrolytes. AKI is common in hospitalized patients and can range from mild impairment to complete organ failure requiring dialysis.

## Causes

AKI causes are traditionally categorized into three types:
1. **Prerenal:** Decreased blood flow to the kidney (e.g., dehydration, sepsis, heart failure, blood loss).
2. **Intrinsic (Renal):** Direct damage to the kidney tissue (e.g., glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, nephrotoxic drugs like NSAIDs).
3. **Postrenal:** Blockage of urine flow (e.g., kidney stones, enlarged prostate, bladder tumors).
