# Lecithin Cholesterol Acyltransferase Deficiency

## Overview

Lecithin-Cholesterol Acyltransferase (LCAT) Deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The LCAT enzyme is responsible for the formation of cholesteryl esters, a crucial step in the transport of cholesterol from tissues to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport). Deficiency leads to very low HDL levels and the accumulation of free cholesterol in tissues like the cornea and kidneys.

## Variants

1.  **Familial LCAT Deficiency (FLD):** Complete enzyme deficiency. Severe symptoms including kidney failure and anemia.
2.  **Fish-Eye Disease (FED):** Partial enzyme deficiency. Primary symptom is corneal opacity; kidney function is usually preserved.
