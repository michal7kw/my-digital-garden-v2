# Knee Osteoarthritis

## Overview

Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the knee. It is a "wear and tear" condition where the protective cartilage cushions between the bones (femur, tibia, and patella) wear away. As the disease progresses, bone rubs on bone, producing painful bone spurs.

## Pathophysiology

It involves the degradation of articular cartilage, subchondral bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, and inflammation of the synovium.
