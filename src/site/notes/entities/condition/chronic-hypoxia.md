# Chronic Hypoxia

## Overview

Chronic Hypoxia differs from acute hypoxia by its gradual onset and the body's adaptive responses, such as **Polycythemia** (increased red blood cell production). Over time, it leads to structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature and can cause right-sided heart failure.

## Complications

- **Pulmonary Hypertension.**
- **Cor Pulmonale:** Right heart failure.
- **Secondary Polycythemia.**
- **Cognitive Decline.**
