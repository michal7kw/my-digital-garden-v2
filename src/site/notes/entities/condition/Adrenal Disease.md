# Adrenal Disease

## Overview

Adrenal Disease encompasses various conditions affecting the adrenal glands, which are responsible for producing hormones like cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenaline. Common disorders include **Addison's Disease** (insufficiency), **Cushing's Syndrome** (excess cortisol), and **Pheochromocytoma** (excess adrenaline).

## Types

- **Adrenal Insufficiency:** Inadequate production of cortisol/aldosterone.
- **Hypercortisolism:** Overproduction of cortisol.
- **Hyperaldosteronism:** Overproduction of aldosterone, leading to hypertension.
- **Adrenal Medulla Tumors:** Excess catecholamine production.
