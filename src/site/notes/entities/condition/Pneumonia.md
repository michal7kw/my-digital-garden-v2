# Pneumonia

## Overview

Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It ranges from mild to life-threatening. The air sacs fill with pus and other liquid, preventing oxygen from reaching the bloodstream efficiently.

## Types

1.  **Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP):** Most common. Caught outside of hospitals.
2.  **Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP):** Caught during a hospital stay. Often more resistant bacteria.
3.  **Aspiration Pneumonia:** Caused by inhaling food, drink, or vomit into lungs.
